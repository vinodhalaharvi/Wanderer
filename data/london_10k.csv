Lineup:  Shahram Nazeri (v/setar), Davlatmand Kholov (v/setar/ghijak), &amp; musicians playing tar, oud, kamancheh, tanbour, rubab, tablak, daf, udu/water drum/singing bowl.

This concert organised by Mana Naqsh launched a new international cultural project &quot;The Language of Love&quot; to promote Persian poetry. It brought together major figures in Persian and Tajik music. Shahram Nazeri is a Kurd from Kermanshah is the western part of Iran. He performs Classical Persian and Kurdish music, and is particularly known for his settings of Rumi poems. Davlatmand Kholov comes from the southern Tajik city of Kulya and performs the traditional musical style of Falak (found across the Pamir Mountains of Central Asia, northeastern Afghanistan and  northern Pakistan as well as southeastern Tajikistan). He is normally accompanied by a large ensemble including five of his sons. Two of the ensemble were present here. The other musicians were billed as the Mana ensemble. I have been them both before (Nazeri in 2004 at the Royal Festival Hall and 2007 at the Barbican with the Rumi Ensemble, and Davlatmand in 2004 at the Theatre de la Ville in Paris).

Seen here against a deep blue sky Buckingham Palace looked particularly striking.

From Wikipedia : &quot;Buckingham Palace is the London residence and administrative headquarters of the monarch of the United Kingdom. Located in the City of Westminster, the palace is often at the centre of state occasions and royal hospitality. It has been a focal point for the British people at times of national rejoicing and mourning.

Originally known as Buckingham House, the building at the core of today's palace was a large townhouse built for the Duke of Buckingham in 1703 on a site that had been in private ownership for at least 150 years. It was acquired by King George III in 1761 as a private residence for Queen Charlotte and became known as The Queen's House. During the 19th century it was enlarged, principally by architects John Nash and Edward Blore, who constructed three wings around a central courtyard. Buckingham Palace became the London residence of the British monarch on the accession of Queen Victoria in 1837.&quot;

The roof was designed by Buro Happold and the architects Foster and Partners, and its blue tint gives the space a slightly other-worldly feel. Not easy to see here, but the Reading Room is a rotunda in the centre, inspired by the domed Pantheon in Rome. It was designed by Sydney Smirke (1798–1877), and work on creating it began in 1854. Using cast iron, concrete, glass and the latest heating and ventilation systems, it was a masterpiece of mid-nineteenth century technology. The room had a diameter of 140 feet (approximately 42.6m). A number of bookstacks were built surrounding the new Reading Room, made of iron to take the weight of the books and protect them against fire. In all they contained three miles (4.8 kilometres) of bookcases and twenty-five miles (forty kilometres) of shelves.","britishmuseum, london, readingroom, greatcourt, roof",11,51.519281,-0.12705,NA,NA,"2019-04-29 15:06:15"

Unfortunately the upper floor, seen here, isn't open to the public (yet?) and it proved difficult to photograph thanks to the ongoing development that surrounds it.  

It was worth a visit though but I would say it was pretty quiet for a Friday lunchtime.  Assuming London needs more high end retail space presumably things will pick up once word gets around.

From Wikipedia : &quot;The £100m project called for the listed Victorian sheds to be converted into a new high-end, 9,290 sq metre, shopping complex and privately owned public space. Thomas Heatherwick took the two converging arcaded sheds and connected them with the 'kissing roof. The two brick and wrought iron coal drops were designed at different times so were structurally different, but shared a common roof line. Heatherwick's scheme takes the analogy of how a strip of paper can be twisted, and does the same to the slate roof finish. He uses the brick sheds as a base, and constructs the plastic form of the roof from steel tubing. The result is an additional glazed space, in the roof, two storeys high that adds 20,000 square feet (1,900 m2) of space. The 35m wide roof adds no extra weight to the wall structures; it is supported on a 54 steel columns that are embedded within the building. The slate used in the roof comes from the same seam in the same Welsh slate quarry as was used in the original roof.

There are 9290 square metres of shopping space, in units ranging from 15 to 1,800 square metres.&quot;

From Wikipedia : &quot;The £100m project called for the listed Victorian sheds to be converted into a new high-end, 9,290 sq metre, shopping complex and privately owned public space. Thomas Heatherwick took the two converging arcaded sheds and connected them with the 'kissing roof. The two brick and wrought iron coal drops were designed at different times so were structurally different, but shared a common roof line. Heatherwick's scheme takes the analogy of how a strip of paper can be twisted, and does the same to the slate roof finish. He uses the brick sheds as a base, and constructs the plastic form of the roof from steel tubing. The result is an additional glazed space, in the roof, two storeys high that adds 20,000 square feet (1,900 m2) of space. The 35m wide roof adds no extra weight to the wall structures; it is supported on a 54 steel columns that are embedded within the building. The slate used in the roof comes from the same seam in the same Welsh slate quarry as was used in the original roof.

There are 9290 square metres of shopping space, in units ranging from 15 to 1,800 square metres.&quot;

I've seen a lot of these 'random' facades in places like Denmark and Holland but not that many in the UK.

Apparently it's modelled on Paul and his wife but if you get a chance to see it let me know if you also think they look rather like a pair of aliens......

From Wikipedia : &quot;The sculpture received a poor critical reception, being cited by Antony Gormley as &quot;a very good example of the crap out there&quot;, comparing it to other examples of public art in the UK, and later referred to as a &quot;terrible, schmaltzy, sentimental piece of kitsch&quot; by Tim Marlow of the Royal Academy of Arts. Jeremy Deller dismissed it as &quot;barely a work of art&quot;. Day commented that &quot;[a] lot of people will no doubt detest it because it is not violent or controversial&quot;.

Further controversy was caused by Day's 2008 planned addition of a bronze relief frieze around the plinth. Originally depicting a commuter falling into the path of an Underground train driven by the Grim Reaper, Day believed the piece to be a &quot;tragi-comic style and was supposed to be a metaphor for the way people’s imaginations ran wild&quot; but revised the frieze before the final version was installed.

Despite harsh criticism from major figures in the British art world, the statue has become popular with the public and contributed to its perception of St Pancras. In 2011, an edition of &quot;The World’s Most Romantic Spots&quot; by Lonely Planet described the station as one of the most romantic meeting places in the world, citing the statue as a key reason.&quot;

From Wikipedia : &quot;The Queen Elizabeth II Great Court, commonly referred to simply as the Great Court, is the covered central quadrangle of the British Museum in London. It was redeveloped during the late 1990s to a design by Foster and Partners, from a 1970s design by Colin St John Wilson. The court was opened by Queen Elizabeth II in 2000. 

The court has a tessellated glass roof designed by Buro Happold and executed by Waagner-Biro, covering the entire court and surrounds the original circular British Museum Reading Room in the centre, now a museum. It is the largest covered square in Europe. The glass and steel roof is made up of 4,878 unique steel members connected at 1,566 unique nodes and 1,656 pairs of glass windowpanes making up 6,100m2 of glazing; each of a unique shape because of the undulating nature of the roof.

Controversially, some of the stone in the court is from France, rather than being Portland Stone from southern England as agreed in the original contract with the masons.

Within the Great Court, there are shops and a café. The court acts as a central linking point for the museum, somewhat like I. M. Pei's Louvre Pyramid in Paris.&quot;

The Abbey was founded in 960AD, but the building we see today dates from the 13th century. More than 3,000 people are buried and many others commemorated here. This has also been the setting for every coronation since 1066, and for many other royal occasions, including 16 weddings.

Looking into the sun with a fisheye lensmakes it pretty impossible to avoid flare despite trying as I did here to hide it behind a piece of roof structure.

With this mono version I was able to emphasize the shadows created by the roof structure.

From Wikipedia : &quot;The Queen Elizabeth II Great Court, commonly referred to simply as the Great Court, is the covered central quadrangle of the British Museum in London. It was redeveloped during the late 1990s to a design by Foster and Partners, from a 1970s design by Colin St John Wilson. The court was opened by Queen Elizabeth II in 2000. 

The court has a tessellated glass roof designed by Buro Happold and executed by Waagner-Biro, covering the entire court and surrounds the original circular British Museum Reading Room in the centre, now a museum. It is the largest covered square in Europe. The glass and steel roof is made up of 4,878 unique steel members connected at 1,566 unique nodes and 1,656 pairs of glass windowpanes making up 6,100m2 of glazing; each of a unique shape because of the undulating nature of the roof.

Controversially, some of the stone in the court is from France, rather than being Portland Stone from southern England as agreed in the original contract with the masons.

Within the Great Court, there are shops and a café. The court acts as a central linking point for the museum, somewhat like I. M. Pei's Louvre Pyramid in Paris.&quot;

From Wikipedia : &quot;The Queen Elizabeth II Great Court, commonly referred to simply as the Great Court, is the covered central quadrangle of the British Museum in London. It was redeveloped during the late 1990s to a design by Foster and Partners, from a 1970s design by Colin St John Wilson. The court was opened by Queen Elizabeth II in 2000. 

The court has a tessellated glass roof designed by Buro Happold and executed by Waagner-Biro, covering the entire court and surrounds the original circular British Museum Reading Room in the centre, now a museum. It is the largest covered square in Europe. The glass and steel roof is made up of 4,878 unique steel members connected at 1,566 unique nodes and 1,656 pairs of glass windowpanes making up 6,100m2 of glazing; each of a unique shape because of the undulating nature of the roof.

Controversially, some of the stone in the court is from France, rather than being Portland Stone from southern England as agreed in the original contract with the masons.

Within the Great Court, there are shops and a café. The court acts as a central linking point for the museum, somewhat like I. M. Pei's Louvre Pyramid in Paris.&quot;

Controversially, some of the stone in the court is from France, rather than being Portland Stone from southern England as agreed in the original contract with the masons.

Within the Great Court, there are shops and a café. The court acts as a central linking point for the museum, somewhat like I. M. Pei's Louvre Pyramid in Paris.&quot;

Of course the view is pretty similar but the 8mm has enabled me to give the picture a stronger 'frame'.

From Wikipedia : &quot;The Queen Elizabeth II Great Court, commonly referred to simply as the Great Court, is the covered central quadrangle of the British Museum in London. It was redeveloped during the late 1990s to a design by Foster and Partners, from a 1970s design by Colin St John Wilson. The court was opened by Queen Elizabeth II in 2000. 

The court has a tessellated glass roof designed by Buro Happold and executed by Waagner-Biro, covering the entire court and surrounds the original circular British Museum Reading Room in the centre, now a museum. It is the largest covered square in Europe. The glass and steel roof is made up of 4,878 unique steel members connected at 1,566 unique nodes and 1,656 pairs of glass windowpanes making up 6,100m2 of glazing; each of a unique shape because of the undulating nature of the roof.

Controversially, some of the stone in the court is from France, rather than being Portland Stone from southern England as agreed in the original contract with the masons.

Within the Great Court, there are shops and a café. The court acts as a central linking point for the museum, somewhat like I. M. Pei's Louvre Pyramid in Paris.&quot;

From Wikipedia : &quot;The Queen Elizabeth II Great Court, commonly referred to simply as the Great Court, is the covered central quadrangle of the British Museum in London. It was redeveloped during the late 1990s to a design by Foster and Partners, from a 1970s design by Colin St John Wilson. The court was opened by Queen Elizabeth II in 2000. 

The court has a tessellated glass roof designed by Buro Happold and executed by Waagner-Biro, covering the entire court and surrounds the original circular British Museum Reading Room in the centre, now a museum. It is the largest covered square in Europe. The glass and steel roof is made up of 4,878 unique steel members connected at 1,566 unique nodes and 1,656 pairs of glass windowpanes making up 6,100m2 of glazing; each of a unique shape because of the undulating nature of the roof.

Controversially, some of the stone in the court is from France, rather than being Portland Stone from southern England as agreed in the original contract with the masons.

Within the Great Court, there are shops and a café. The court acts as a central linking point for the museum, somewhat like I. M. Pei's Louvre Pyramid in Paris.&quot;

Messier 101, also known as the Pinwheel Galaxy or NGC 5457. This image was taken on the 12th April 2019 but I've only just gotten around to posting it. M101 is a face-on spiral galaxy distanced 21 million light-years away from Earth in the constellation Ursa Major. Discovered by Pierre Méchain on March 27, 1781, it was communicated to Charles Messier who verified its position for inclusion in the Messier Catalogue as one of its final entries. It has a diameter of 170,000 light-years. By comparison, the Milky Way has a diameter of 258,000 light years, however it has around a trillion stars, twice the number in the Milky Way.

Its name commemorates the Battle of Trafalgar, a British naval victory in the Napoleonic Wars with France and Spain that took place on 21 October 1805 off the coast of Cape Trafalgar.

The site of Trafalgar Square had been a significant landmark since the 13th century. The 169-foot (52 m) Nelson's Column at its centre is guarded by four lion statues. A number of commemorative statues and sculptures occupy the square.

The square has been used for community gatherings and political demonstrations, including Bloody Sunday in 1887, the culmination of the first Aldermaston March, anti-war protests, and campaigns against climate change. A Christmas tree has been donated to the square by Norway since 1947 and is erected for twelve days before and after Christmas Day. The square is a centre of annual celebrations on New Year's Eve. It was well known for its feral pigeons until their removals in the early 21st century.

I was originally enrolled into the GETTY IMAGES collection as a contributor on April 9th 2012, and when links with FLICKR were terminated in March 2014, I was retained and fortunate enough to be signed up via a second contract, both of which have proved to be successful with sales of my photographs all over the world now handled exclusively by them. 

 


On November 12th 2015 GETTY IMAGES unveiled plans for a new stills upload platform called ESP (Enterprise Submission Platform), to replace the existing 'Moment portal', and on November 13th I was invited to Beta test the new system prior to it being officially rolled out in December. ESP went live on Tuesday December 15th 2015 and has smoothed out the upload process considerably.


These days I take a far more leisurely approach to my photographic exploits, a Nikon D850 FX Pro body as my trusted companion, I travel light with less constraints and more emphasis on the pure capture of the beauty that I see, more akin to my original persuits and goals some five decades previously when starting out. I would like to say a huge and heartfelt 'THANK YOU' to GETTY IMAGES, and the 31.876+ Million visitors to my FLICKR site.

Unlike comparable museums in continental Europe, the National Gallery was not formed by nationalising an existing royal or princely art collection. It came into being when the British government bought 38 paintings from the heirs of John Julius Angerstein in 1824. After that initial purchase the Gallery was shaped mainly by its early directors, notably Sir Charles Lock Eastlake, and by private donations, which today account for two-thirds of the collection. The collection is small compared with many European national galleries, but encyclopaedic in scope; most major developments in Western painting &quot;from Giotto to Cézanne&quot; are represented with important works. It used to be claimed that this was one of the few national galleries that had all its works on permanent exhibition,[6] but this is no longer the case.

Situated in the City Of Westminster, the Park spans twenty three Hectares and is the oldest of the Royal Parks of London, with a variety of visiting and nesting birds that include Ducks, Canada Geese and Pelicans.


Here we see a female Bar-headed goose (Answer Indicus), native to Central Asia from the Tian-Shans to Ladakh and Kokonor and breeding grounds in northern India, Assam and northern Burma. These are far from common in the UK, with only a handful of breeding pairs seen, though often as in this case, a lone mother with up to three chicks (here sadly only one).

From 1960 to 1980, trade in the docks declined to almost nothing. There were two main reasons. First, the development of the shipping container made this type of relatively small dock inefficient, and the dock-owners were slow to embrace change. Second, the manufacturing exports which had maintained the trade through the docks dwindled and moved away from the local area. In 1980 the docks were closed and the Government took control of the land. 

After the closure of the upstream enclosed docks, the area was regenerated as part of the Docklands scheme, and is now home to the developments of Canary Wharf.

Parts of the western end of the south docks is being built over in new developments currently under construction.

South Dock regularly plays host to medium-sized military vessels visiting London as it is the furthest point upstream that they can be turned around. ","southdock, london",20,51.502014,-0.020234,"Woking","England","2018-09-15 09:50:59"

Male Large Skippers are most often found perching in a prominent, sunny position, usually on a large leaf at a boundary between taller and shorter vegetation, awaiting passing females. Females are less conspicuous, though both sexes may be seen feeding on flowers, Bramble being a favourite. Males have a thick black line through the center of their fore-wing. Undersides have faint orange spots unlike the bright silver spots in Silver-spotted Skipper. 
The presence of a faint chequered pattern on both sides of the wings distinguishes this species from the similar Small and Essex Skippers, which fly at the same time. The Large Skipper is widespread in southern Britain and its range has extended northwards in north-east England since the 1960s.

This is the most abundant and least choosy of the hoverflies associated with decaying wood. The larvae, which are of the ‘long-tailed’, aquatic type, occur in any situation where wet wood debris are present, such as water-filled hollows containing decaying leaf and wood detritus, and decaying roots deep underground. They can also develop in cow-dung. They will readily use artificial breeding sites consisting of containers of water mixed with rotted sawdust or woodland litter.

Adults disperse widely and visit a variety of flowers. Males hover in the canopy, making a loud high pitched buzz. They are often seen in gardens

They were originally part of the temple of the Parthenon and other buildings on the Acropolis of Athens     In November 1798 the Earl of Elgin was appointed as &quot;Ambassador Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary of His Britannic Majesty to the Sublime Porte of Selim III, Sultan of Turkey&quot; (Greece was then part of the Ottoman Empire).  Although his original intention was only to document the sculptures, in 1801 Lord Elgin began to remove material from the Parthenon and its surrounding structures. . Pieces were also removed from the Erechtheion, the Propylaia, and the Temple of Athena Nike, all inside the Acropolis.  The excavation and removal was completed in 1812 at a personal cost to Elgin of around £70,000. Elgin intended to use the marbles to decorate Broomhall House, his private home near Dunfermline in Scotland, but a costly divorce suit forced him to sell them to settle his debts. Elgin sold the Parthenon Marbles to the British government for less than it cost him to procure them, declining higher offers from other potential buyers, including Napoleon.

.


I was originally enrolled into the GETTY IMAGES collection as a contributor on April 9th 2012, and when links with FLICKR were terminated in March 2014, I was retained and fortunate enough to be signed up via a second contract, both of which have proved to be successful with sales of my photographs all over the world now handled exclusively by them. 

 


On November 12th 2015 GETTY IMAGES unveiled plans for a new stills upload platform called ESP (Enterprise Submission Platform), to replace the existing 'Moment portal', and on November 13th I was invited to Beta test the new system prior to it being officially rolled out in December. ESP went live on Tuesday December 15th 2015 and has smoothed out the upload process considerably.


These days I take a far more leisurely approach to my photographic exploits, a Nikon D850 FX Pro body as my trusted companion, I travel light with less constraints and more emphasis on the pure capture of the beauty that I see, more akin to my original persuits and goals some five decades previously when starting out. I would like to say a huge and heartfelt 'THANK YOU' to GETTY IMAGES, and the 31.470+ Million visitors to my FLICKR site. 


***** Selected for sale in the GETTY IMAGES COLLECTION on October 30th 2018

.


I was originally enrolled into the GETTY IMAGES collection as a contributor on April 9th 2012, and when links with FLICKR were terminated in March 2014, I was retained and fortunate enough to be signed up via a second contract, both of which have proved to be successful with sales of my photographs all over the world now handled exclusively by them. 

 


On November 12th 2015 GETTY IMAGES unveiled plans for a new stills upload platform called ESP (Enterprise Submission Platform), to replace the existing 'Moment portal', and on November 13th I was invited to Beta test the new system prior to it being officially rolled out in December. ESP went live on Tuesday December 15th 2015 and has smoothed out the upload process considerably.


These days I take a far more leisurely approach to my photographic exploits, a Nikon D850 FX Pro body as my trusted companion, I travel light with less constraints and more emphasis on the pure capture of the beauty that I see, more akin to my original persuits and goals some five decades previously when starting out. I would like to say a huge and heartfelt 'THANK YOU' to GETTY IMAGES, and the 31.299+ Million visitors to my FLICKR site. 


***** Selected for sale in the GETTY IMAGES COLLECTION on October 29th 2018

.


I was originally enrolled into the GETTY IMAGES collection as a contributor on April 9th 2012, and when links with FLICKR were terminated in March 2014, I was retained and fortunate enough to be signed up via a second contract, both of which have proved to be successful with sales of my photographs all over the world now handled exclusively by them. 

 


On November 12th 2015 GETTY IMAGES unveiled plans for a new stills upload platform called ESP (Enterprise Submission Platform), to replace the existing 'Moment portal', and on November 13th I was invited to Beta test the new system prior to it being officially rolled out in December. ESP went live on Tuesday December 15th 2015 and has smoothed out the upload process considerably.


These days I take a far more leisurely approach to my photographic exploits, a Nikon D850 FX Pro body as my trusted companion, I travel light with less constraints and more emphasis on the pure capture of the beauty that I see, more akin to my original persuits and goals some five decades previously when starting out. I would like to say a huge and heartfelt 'THANK YOU' to GETTY IMAGES, and the 31.070+ Million visitors to my FLICKR site.

A Southeastern Network train from Bexleyheath to London Bridge Station at 07:50am this morning on a beautiful cold  January day and the nice walk back along the South Bank towards Charring Cross Station, mingling with the locals and tourists alike in this wonderful city.


Photograph taken at an altitude of Eighteen metres at 10:59am on Tuesday 30th January 2018 off Montague Close nearby Borough Market beside the statue of Minerva by Alan Collins, positioned on a concrete plinth and located between Minerva house and the Cathedral and Collegiate Church of St Saviour and St Mary Overie, (Southwark Cathedral)  in Central London, England. It is made of fibre-reinforced plastic with powdered aluminium and represents Minerva, the Roman goddess of wisdom and strategic warfare and the sponsor of arts, trade, and strategy.


The statue was reportedly commissioned by the National and Grindlays Bank in 1996, thoiugh they ceased trading under this name in 1997. There is no surviving plinth for the statue.


It is the mother church of the Anglican Diocese of Southwark. It has been a place of Christian worship for over 1,000 years, but a cathedral only since 1905. The present building is mainly Gothic, from 1220 to 1420.
The earliest reference to the site was in the Domesday Book survey of 1086, and it has been a place of Christian worship for over 1,000 years, but a cathedral only since 1905.

HMS Belfast è un ex incrociatore leggero della Royal Navy ora nave museo, ormeggiata permanentemente lungo il Tamigi a Londra, nei pressi del Tower Bridge. La sua costruzione iniziò nel 1936 e al tempo fu la prima nave della Royal Navy ad essere chiamata con il nome della capitale dell’Irlanda del Nord. Fu varata il giorno di San Patrizio del 1938. La Belfast ha scortato i convogli artici in Unione Sovietica nel 1943, e nel dicembre dello stesso anno ha svolto un ruolo importante nella battaglia di Capo Nord, assistendo alla distruzione della nave da battaglia tedesca Scharnhorst. Ha continuato a combattere anche dopo la seconda guerra mondiale e precisamente nel 1950-1952 durante la guerra di Corea e fu rimodernata tra il 1956 e il 1959 prima di essere messa in riserva nel 1963 e poi è diventare un museo.

HMS Belfast is a museum ship, originally a Royal Navy light cruiser, permanently moored in London on the River Thames. Near the Tower Bridge. Construction of Belfast, the first Royal Navy ship to be named after the capital city of Northern Ireland. began in 1936 and she was launched on St Patrick's Day 1938. Belfast saw action escorting Arctic convoys to the Soviet Union during 1943, and in December 1943 played an important role in the Battle of North Cape, assisting in the destruction of the German warship Scharnhorst. Belfast saw further combat action in 1950–52 during the Korean War and underwent an extensive modernisation between 1956 and 1959 before entering reserve in 1963 and then becoming a museum.

The top and middle texts are in Ancient Egyptian using hieroglyphic script and Demotic script, respectively, while the bottom is in Ancient Greek. As the decree has only minor differences between the three versions, the Rosetta Stone proved to be the key to deciphering Egyptian hieroglyphs, thereby opening a window into ancient Egyptian history.                                                      Study of the decree was already under way when the first full translation of the Greek text appeared in 1803. It was 20 years, however, before the transliteration of the Egyptian scripts was announced by Jean-François Champollion in Paris in 1822; it took longer still before scholars were able to read Ancient Egyptian inscriptions and literature confidently. Major advances in the decoding were recognition that the stone offered three versions of the same text (1799); that the demotic text used phonetic characters to spell foreign names (1802); that the hieroglyphic text did so as well, and had pervasive similarities to the demotic (Thomas Young, 1814); and that, in addition to being used for foreign names, phonetic characters were also used to spell native Egyptian words (Champollion, 1822–1824).","deptofancientegyptandsudan, england2018, london, places, thebritishmuseum",6,51.519257,-0.127651,"Washington, DC","US","2018-10-12 12:34:45"

The above shot was taken in 2017, but last Saturday (18.05.19) the final four long distance departures, left Paddington between 1800 - 1830, calling time on these iconic trains on the Great Western Main Line after 43 years, the iconic station full to the rafters with well wishers (and maybe a few train spotters too!).

They are being replaced by the new IC800 Hitachi trains, a design classic (the stylish nose designed by Sir Kenneth Grange), they will be sadly missed :)

The area is a prominent example of 1970s British brutalist architecture, redeveloping an area devasted by WWII bombings. The concrete estate consists of several tower blocks, terraces, grouped around a lake and green squares. Today, the estate also hosts The Barbican Centre, the largest performing arts center of its kind in Europe. Every day, as I commute between the concrete buildings, I never cease to be amazed by photographic opportunities and creative compositions offered by this type of architecture!

33820662148,"80832649@N00","3",NA,"River Thames and Bankside, London EC4, UK","This is the view across the Thames near Blackfriars Pier, from the Thames Path on the northern bank to the southern bank east of the core 'South Bank' district &ndash; if that makes sense.

The Millennium Bridge, officially the 'London Millennium Footbridge', is in the foreground. Linking the City of London (off the left of the image) with Bankside (off the right), the steel suspension pedestrian bridge is aligned to have a terminating vista of St. Paul's Cathedral (as seen in countless tourist photos). Designed by Sir Anthony Caro, Foster &amp; Partners, and Arup Group, with its suspension cables below deck level to meet height restrictions and improve views, the 325 m long bridge was built 1998&ndash;2000. Ninety thousand people visited on the opening day, with up to 2,000 on the bridge at any one time (3,000 fewer than the design allowed), causing an unforeseen resonant response: a severe sway of the deck which immediately closed the bridge for two years of additional work to add motion dampers. Embarassing and expensive, but it's great now.

Bankside Pier is at the right of this image, served by tour boats and water buses. The white, half-timbered Globe Theatre is at the far right, with the Tate Modern gallery further to the right, out of view.

Designed by Sir Ernest George (architect) and Sir Basil Mott (engineer), Southwark Bridge spans the Thames in five steel arches, linking the City with Southwark (oddly enough), south of the river, with a total length of 244 m. It was built 1919&ndash;21 to replace a Georgian bridge (built 1814&ndash;19) which could no longer meet the requirements of modern traffic.
The coloured lighting is a remnant of the 2012 Olympic Games, when six Thames bridges were specially illuminated, their shades gradually shifting, with special effects coordinated to appear on the hour throughout the night. Having spent more than £1.2 million on design, equipment, installation and grants to the bridges' owners, the Greater London Authority decided to retain some of the displays as a permanent legacy of the Games.

The piers of Cannon Street Railway Bridge (1863&ndash;66) are immediately beyond, then London Bridge appears yellow in this light. The current concrete-and-steel box girder bridge opened in 1973 but there have been London Bridges here since the Roman era (c.55CE) and the most famous structure, featuring 19 irregular arches and 200 buildings (some seven storeys tall) stood here for over six centuries, 1209&ndash;1831.

Behind, at the far left, Tower Bridge is an icon of modern London &ndash; many conflate the historic (but in its current incarnation, unspectacular) London Bridge with the Victorian grandeur of neighbouring Tower Bridge and understandably confuse the names. Tower Bridge is a combined bascule and suspension bridge, built 1886&ndash;94; as the name suggests, it directly overlooks the Tower of London.

The Shard is the tallest building in the European Union, the fifth-tallest in wider Europe and the 96th-tallest in the world, at 309.7 m. Counting such structures as TV transmitters, this is the UK's second-tallest free-standing structure.
Designed by Renzo Piano, the Neo-futurist building was constructed 2009&ndash;12 on the site of Southwark Towers, at 100 m itself the tallest building to have been demolished in the UK.
Inspired by London's numerous church spires and the masts of ships which once used the Thames, Piano's building was actually named by criticism, that it would be <em>&quot;a shard of glass through the heart of historic London&quot;</em>. I like it, with its angled glass sides catching the ever-changing light.
Of the 95 storeys, the uppermost 27 are accounted for by a public observatory (floors 68&ndash;72) and spire (73&ndash;95). A viewpoint 244 m above London sounds appealing, but there's no way I'd pay in excess of £20 to visit &ndash; and that's the 2018 'super advance' price; even the normal 'advance' price is over £25 and the 'walk-up' rate over £30.
Apparently the open-air 72nd floor accommodated the Shard's first resident: a fox who'd climbed the central stairwell.","river, thames, millennium, bridge, shard, city, london, uk, ec4v, southwark, globe, theatre, bankside, quay, rnbthames, building, skyscraper, tower, cityoflondon, ec4, hmsbelfast, colour, light, piano, night, shore, longexposure",3,51.510857,-0.103028,"Lancaster","UK","2017-02-25 19:54:04"

Parliament Hill è una collina situata nell'angolo sud-est di Hampstead Heath, nella parte nordoccidentale di Londra. La collina, alta 98 metri, si distingue per la vista sullo skyline della capitale. L'area che era conosciuta come la collina dei traditori, potrebbe aver acquisito il suo nome attuale durante la guerra civile inglese del XVII secolo, quando fu occupata da truppe fedeli al Parlamento inglese. Una leggenda afferma che questo era il sito da cui Guy Fawkes e Robert Catesby, il 5 novembre 1605, progettarono di far saltare in aria il Parlamento.

Parliament Hill is an area of open parkland in the south-east corner of Hampstead Heath in north-west London. The hill, which is 98 metres high, is notable for its views of the capital's skyline. The area that was known as Traitors' Hill, may have acquired its current name during the English Civil Warin the 17th century. When it was occupied by troops loyal to the English Parliament. A legend states that this was the site from where Guy Fawkes and Robert Catesby, of the Gunpowder Plot on November the 5th 1605, planned to watch the destruction of Parliament.

The Chromatic Harp provides an easier and more accurate ways of altering the pitch of strings without retuning or the use of pedals or levers. Harps are naturally diatonic instruments and produce a natural scale when played in succession. Chromatic Harps aim to have a string for every possible pitch. The issue then is how to arrange the strings, so they can be reached with equal ease.

One solution is the inline chromatic harp is a harp where the strings for all 12 chromatic notes of the octave are placed in one row. Another is their being placed in two or three (parallel or crossing) courses. Single course inline chromatic harps have been produced since patented by Karel Weigel of Hanover in 1902.

In 2008 Philippe Volant of Dolo in Brittany made a custom-built chromatic pedal-less harp with a single row of strings for Laura Perrudin. Then in 2014 she asked Volant to make an electric version of this harp.

Chromatic Harps are assigned the number 322.212.1 in the Hornbostel-Sachs classification of musical instruments (<a rel=""""noreferrer nofollow""""> <a href=""""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hornbostel-Sachs"""">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hornbostel-Sachs</a> </a>), indicating:
3 = Chordophone. Instruments where the sound is primarily produced by the vibration of a string or strings that are stretched between fixed points.
32 = Composite Chordophone. Acoustic and electro-acoustic instruments which have a resonator as an integral part of the instrument, and solid-body electric chordophones.
322 = Instruments where the plane of the strings lies perpendicular to the resonator's surface.
322.2 = Frame Harp. The harp has a pillar.
322.21 = Without tuning mechanism. 
322.211 = Diatonic frame harps.
322.212 = Chromatic frame harps. 
322.212.1 = With all strings in one plane. Inline chromatic harp.

From Wikipedia : &quot;The London Eye is a cantilevered observation wheel on the South Bank of the River Thames in London. It is Europe's tallest cantilevered observation wheel, is the most popular paid tourist attraction in the United Kingdom with over 3.75 million visitors annually, and has made many appearances in popular culture.

The structure is 135 metres (443 ft) tall and the wheel has a diameter of 120 metres (394 ft). When it opened to the public in 2000 it was the world's tallest Ferris wheel. Its height was surpassed by the 525-foot (160 m) Star of Nanchang in 2006, the 165 metres (541 ft) Singapore Flyer in 2008, and the 550-foot tall (167.6 m) High Roller (Las Vegas) in 2014. Supported by an A-frame on one side only, unlike the taller Nanchang and Singapore wheels, the Eye is described by its operators as &quot;the world's tallest cantilevered observation wheel&quot;.

The London Eye offered the highest public viewing point in London until it was superseded by the 245-metre (804 ft) high observation deck on the 72nd floor of The Shard, which opened to the public on 1 February 2013.&quot;

This is the second Blackfriars Bridge; the first was an Italianate-style toll bridge spanning 303 m in nine semi-elliptical stone arches, built for the Corporation of the City of London and opened in 1769 as the third bridge across the Thames within built-up London, following London Bridge (also owned by the Corporation) and Westminster Bridge (the rival!). Originally named the 'William Pitt Bridge' after the Prime Minister, it soon became better known for its location, near the site of a Dominican (Black Friars) priory. More specifically, the mouth of the River Fleet had left a gap in the northern wharfside, so the Bridge was built over it rather than disrupt neighbouring commerce. The Fleet still emerges from a culvert beneath the Bridge.

Much repaired, the faulty bridge was finally replaced entirely in 1869, as part of the Victoria Embankment development. This one, by Joseph Cubitt and now Grade II Listed, spans 281 m on five wrought iron arches. Initially 21 m wide, it was extended to 32 m in 1907-10 to accommodate increasing traffic. Like London Bridge, the full length of Blackfriars Bridge remains within the jurisdiction of the City.
The intricate carvings are by John Birnie Philip, depicting seabirds and other marine fauna on this, the downstream side, whilst the upstream side features freshwater birds. 

The coloured lighting is a remnant of the 2012 Olympic Games, when six Thames bridges were specially illuminated, their shades gradually shifting, with special effects coordinated to appear on the hour throughout the night. Having spent more than £1.2 million on design, equipment, installation and grants to the bridges' owners, the Greater London Authority decided to retain some of the displays as a permanent legacy of the Games.

To the left are the redundant pillars of the first Blackfriars Railway Bridge, which was also designed by Cubitt and aligned with his road bridge (or <em>vice versa</em>: the Railway Bridge opened first, in 1864).
However, with changed traffic priorities and rolling stock, Cubitt's bridge soon became obsolete and merely supplemented the adjacent St Paul's Railway Bridge (1886, by John Wolfe-Barry and Henry Marc Brunel - the sons of architect Sir Charles Barry and engineer Isambard Kingdom Brunel). Use of the original declined after 1922 and in 1937 St Paul's inherited the 'Blackfriars' name.
The original's deck was finally removed in 1985, though the easternmost pillars now partially support the modern London Blackfriars station, the platforms of which extend right across the Thames beneath a roof covered by 4,400 photovoltaic solar panels, meeting half the station's energy requirements and making this the world's largest (of only three, admittedly) solar bridges.

The 163 m tower on the south bank is One Blackfriars, under construction at the time of photo but opened in 2018, in a prime location previously occupied by the headquarters of Sainsbury's supermarket for over a century.
The 52-storey building was quickly nicknamed 'The Boomerang', 'The Vase' or 'The Tummy', as it's widest halfway up, tapering in at the bottom as well as at the top, to provide uninterrupted views from Waterloo Bridge to The Shard, which should fit right between it and the South Bank Tower (Kings Reach Tower, as was). 
Planning regulations also specify that new residential developments must contain a certain proportion of 'affordable' housing, but the developers reportedly made a £29m payment in lieu of that, and the building's 274 flats cost between £1.15M and £23m.

The Iceofon is one of a range of instruments made from blocks of ice sourced from nature using tools lke chainsaws, knives and drills just before the performance. This one is a type of xylophone.

This instrument was made by Terje Isungset from a block of ice brought from his home area in Norway.

Iceofons are assigned the number 111.212 in the Hornbostel-Sachs classification of musical instruments (<a rel=""""noreferrer nofollow""""> <a href=""""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hornbostel-Sachs"""">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hornbostel-Sachs</a> </a>), indicating:
1 = Idiophones. Sound is primarily produced by the actual body of the instrument vibrating, rather than a string, membrane, or column of air.
11 = Struck Idiophones. These idiophones are set in vibration by being struck.
111 = Directly Struck Idiophones. The player himself executes the movement of striking; whether by mechanical intermediate devices, beaters, keyboards, or by pulling ropes, etc.
111.2 = Percussive idiophones. The instrument is struck either with a non-sonorous object (hand, stick, striker) or against a non-sonorous object (human body, the ground).
111.21 = Percussion sticks.
112.212 = Sets of percussion sticks.

33501409718,"80832649@N00","3",NA,"St Paul's Cathedral, City of London EC4, UK","St Paul's Cathedral stands on Ludgate Hill at the heart of the City of London. A church dedicated to St. Paul has occupied the site since 604, but Sir Christopher Wren's English Baroque masterpiece, the fourth cathedral on the site, was built after the 1666 Great Fire of London, being (officially) completed in 1711.  The tallest building in London until 1962, St Paul's remains the second largest (by volume) church in the UK, with one of the highest (at 111 m tall) and 'most perfect' domes in the world.  Aside from being a true icon of London, it's the nearest the UK has to a 'national' church, having been the venue of key funerals, weddings and commemorations of British history.
Seen from here in Watling Street, the south transept is on the left, with the choir and chancel at the right and the amazing dome over the crossing.

The church of St Augustine, Watling Street is known to have existed before 1148, though it was rebuilt and enlarged over subsequent centuries &ndash; before being destroyed in the Great Fire of 1666. The replacement was designed by Sir Christopher Wren and built , using the existing stones as foundations,1680&ndash;84. However, the steeple, by Nicholas Hawksmoor, wasn't completed until 1695&ndash;96.  This lead spire was replaced, to a modified design, in 1830.
St Augustine’s was bombed in 1941, leaving just the tower (and lead spires don't react well to fire...).  Previously closely confined by surrounding buildings destroyed by war, the tower, here silhouetted against its neighbour, emerged as a feature retained in the Festival Gardens created for the 1951 Festival of Britain. The spire was added again in 1967, to Hawksmoor's original design featuring the distinctive elongated onion dome.
The adjoining St Paul's Cathedral Choir School was built in 1962-67 (it's now Grade II* Listed) incorporating the restored tower (Grade I Listed); functionally, that's as a fire escape but more importantly as an example of Wren and Hawksmoor's work and a remnant of the closest City of London Church to St. Paul's.","stpauls, cathedral, watling, street, cityoflondon, city, london, ec4, uk, st, augustine, church, tower, wren, hawksmoor, festival, gardens, dome, paul, rain, night",6,51.513362,-0.095803,"Lancaster","UK","2017-02-25 20:02:35"

The Concertina was developed in the 1830s in both England and Germany. It differs from the Accordion in having buttons in the same direction as the bellows rather than perpendicular. There are two keyboards of buttons, one at each end of the instruments bellows. Each button has an individual note.

There are several different types of Concertina. The English Concertina is octagonal and unisonoric (the same note on push and draw). The German Concertina (Chemnitzer) is rectangular and bisonoric (a different note on push and draw). There is also an Anglo-German Concertina (usually just called an Anglo) developed later in the 1860s which is closer to the English shape (usually hexagonal) and has the German note system. Other difference between the English and Anglo Concertinas are: the former have thumb straps and the latter hand straps, the rows of buttons on the former are straight and on the latter slightly curved downwards. The Duet Concertina is harder to pin down as there are a number of different systems. They are all unisonoric and have the bass notes are on the left side and the treble are on the right. The player can then play the melody on the right hand, with an accompaniment on the left, thus the name Duet.

This is a c.1870 Lachenal Anglo Concertina.

Louis Lachenal used to work for C. Wheatstone &amp; Co before forming his own company in the 1850s.

Concertinas are assigned the number 412.132 in the Hornbostel-Sachs classification of musical instruments (<a rel=""""noreferrer nofollow""""> <a href=""""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hornbostel-Sachs"""">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hornbostel-Sachs</a> </a>), indicating:

412 = Interruptive Free Aerophones. The air-stream is interrupted periodically.

The Melodeon is the name used In England for the Diatonic Accordion (though the player may well be using an instrument manufactured in continental Europe and known there as an Accordion). A Melodeon has between 1 and 3 rows of button on the right hand side, and is bisonoric (giving a different note when the bellows are pushed and drawn).

Saul Rose plays Melodeon made by the Italian company Castagnari. Probably a 2½ row Dony (21 + 5 buttons and 12 bass buttons).

Parliament Hill è una collina situata nell'angolo sud-est di Hampstead Heath, nella parte nordoccidentale di Londra. La collina, alta 98 metri, si distingue per la vista sullo skyline della capitale. L'area che era conosciuta come la collina dei traditori, potrebbe aver acquisito il suo nome attuale durante la guerra civile inglese del XVII secolo, quando fu occupata da truppe fedeli al Parlamento inglese. Una leggenda afferma che questo era il sito da cui Guy Fawkes e Robert Catesby, il 5 novembre 1605, progettarono di far saltare in aria il Parlamento.

Parliament Hill is an area of open parkland in the south-east corner of Hampstead Heath in north-west London. The hill, which is 98 metres high, is notable for its views of the capital's skyline. The area that was known as Traitors' Hill, may have acquired its current name during the English Civil Warin the 17th century. When it was occupied by troops loyal to the English Parliament. A legend states that this was the site from where Guy Fawkes and Robert Catesby, of the Gunpowder Plot on November the 5th 1605, planned to watch the destruction of Parliament.

However, the Cripplegate ward was devastated by World War II bombing: by 1951 its resident population was 48.

This provided an opportunity for comprehensive, unified redevelopment, the result being the 16 ha Barbican Estate (three towers and 13 terrace blocks plus ancillary elements) fully integrated with the Barbican Centre (the largest arts centre of its kind in Europe), the Museum of London, the Guildhall School of Music and Drama, the City of London School for Girls and a public library. The Barbican Complex as a whole is a key example of British Brutalist architecture and is Grade II Listed, not least for the cohesion of its design, by Chamberlin, Powell and Bon. Built 1963-1976, it now accommodates 4,000 people in 2,014 flats.

This is Shakespeare Tower, completed in 1976. Together with Cromwell Tower (1973) and Lauderdale Tower (1974), these were the tallest residential towers in London, at 123 m, until overtaken in 2009 by the Pan Peninsula development on the Isle of Dogs.
Shakespeare Tower is 42 storeys tall (plus underground garage and foyer at street level.  The impression of extreme height is enhanced by a triangular cross-section; 113 3-bedroom flats each account for one side of the triangle, with one 2-floor, 4-bedroom penthouse and two 3-floor, 5-bedroom penthouses occupying the top.

The curve of these cantilevered balconies was intended to enhance a sense of safety and diminish the vertigo-inducing impression of living on an unbroken concrete. Upper balconies also shield those below from weather, and the curve is a unifying motif across the estate.  I like the weathered patina, too.","balcony, shakespeare, tower, barbican, city, london, ec2, uk, estate, centre, complex, cripplegate, brutalist, architecture, concrete, patina",3,51.520473,-0.095433,"Lancaster","UK","2016-05-31 12:54:51"

I'm stampolina and I love to take photos of stamps. Thanks for visiting this pages on flickr.

I'm neither a typical collector of stamps, nor a stamp dealer. I'm only a stamp photograph. I'm fascinated of the fine close-up structures which are hidden in this small stamp-pictures. Please don't ask of the worth of these stamps - the most ones have a worth of a few cents or still less. 

<b>By the way,  I wanna say thank you to all flickr users who have sent me stamps! Great! Thank you!</b> Someone sent me 3 or 5 stamps, another one sent me more than 20 stamps in a letter. It's everytime a great surprise for me and I'm everytime happy to get letters with stamps inside from you! 
thx, stampolina

For the case you wanna send also stamps - it is possible. (...I'm pretty sure you'll see these stamps on this photostream on flickr :) thx!

Selon la légende familiale, l'étudiant sicilien Bartolomeo Savona a été interprète de Derain lors de son premier séjour à  Londres début mars 1906, notamment pour visiter un dentiste. Ce dernier a ensuite peint son portrait en trois séances de vingt minutes pour le remercier. 

L'artiste utilise ici des couleurs crues et accrocheuses, avec des brosses exubérantes pour créer une image vivante et sympathique. Des œuvres similaires l’avaient conduit, lui et  Henri Matisse, à être surnommés Fauves quand ils avaient exposé à Paris au salon d'automne, l’année précédente (cf. Institute of Art).","derain, 1906, londres",1,51.511319,-0.10437,"Vauréal (Cergy-Pontoise)","France","2016-02-13 05:14:09"

32367783697,"80832649@N00","3",NA,"Shakespeare Tower, Barbican, City of London, London EC2, UK","As long ago as the 2nd Century, this area on the northern side of the City was occupied by a gatehouse in London's walls, known as 'Cripplegate' either for its covered passage or its beggars. However, the Cripplegate ward was devastated by World War II bombing: by 1951 its resident population was 48.

This provided an opportunity for comprehensive, unified redevelopment, the result being the 16 ha Barbican Estate (three towers and 13 terrace blocks plus ancillary elements) fully integrated with the Barbican Centre (the largest arts centre of its kind in Europe), the Museum of London, the Guildhall School of Music and Drama, the City of London School for Girls and a public library. The Barbican Complex as a whole is a key example of British Brutalist architecture and is Grade II Listed, not least for the cohesion of its design, by Chamberlin, Powell and Bon. Built 1963-1976, it now accommodates 4,000 people in 2,014 flats.

This is Shakespeare Tower, completed in 1976, with Cromwell Tower (1973) behind.
Together with Lauderdale Tower (1974), these were the tallest residential towers in London, at 123 m, until overtaken in 2009 by the Pan Peninsula development on the Isle of Dogs.
Shakespeare Tower is 42 storeys tall (plus underground garage and foyer at street level.  The impression of extreme height is enhanced by a triangular cross-section; 113 3-bedroom flats each account for one side of the triangle, with one 2-floor, 4-bedroom penthouse and two 3-floor, 5-bedroom penthouses occupying the top.

The curved building between the towers is Frobisher Crescent, part of the Barbican Centre though incorporating 69 studio flats.

Heron Tower (110 Bishopsgate), a kilometre away at the lower right of the image, is 230 m tall including its 28 m mast, making it the tallest building in the City of London and third tallest in Greater London (and the UK), after the Shard and One Canada Square, Canary Wharf. Built 2007-2011, it has 46 storeys.","shakespeare, tower, barbican, city, london, ec2, uk, estate, centre, complex, cripplegate, brutalist, architecture, cromwell, frobishercrescent, heron, bishopsgate, concrete, flower, tree, sky",1,51.520362,-0.095665,"Lancaster","UK","2016-05-31 12:54:26"

46250517835,"21506908@N07","1","Lazy","Detail of the Humble monument at Southwark Cathedral","* I have been to London countless times but until 2016 I had not visited Southwark Cathedral. It’s situated on the South Bank of the Thames near London Bridge not as well known as St Pauls or Westminster Abbey perhaps but it is rather splendid. It's very near the site of the original Globe theatre it is highly likely to have been where Shakespeare attended religious services. 

This photograph shows the Humble Monument l it consists of three, beautifully carved, family members, kneeling, it particularly caught my eye when  I visited the Cathedral.  It is a monument to Richard Humble (died 1616) and his two wives, Margaret and Isabel and was made by Flemish refugee sculptors living and working on Bankside.  The coffered arch is typical of their work which is sometimes referred to as “The Southwark School”.  It was given a marbleised finish during an 1876 restoration unfortunately as it gives a very different feel to the original work. The Monument is on the left side of the High Alter this is seen in the background of this image 

Southwark Cathedral records show that Humble, a city alderman, was a member of the church vestry – the laity helping with the day to day running of the church and its charities.  It also notes that despite his involvement with the Church, he was once fined for allowing his sheep to graze in the churchyard without permission!

THANKS FOR YOUR VISITING BUT CAN I ASK YOU NOT TO FAVE AN IMAGE WITHOUT ALSO MAKING A COMMENT.  MANY THANKS KEITH. ANYONE MAKING MULTIPLE FAVES WITHOUT COMMENTS WILL SIMPLY BE BLOCKED

47928072753,"133876835@N08","3",NA,"London - London Bridge","Several bridges named London Bridge have spanned the River Thames between the City of London and Southwark, in central London. The current crossing, which opened to traffic in 1973, is a box girder bridge built from concrete and steel. It replaced a 19th-century stone-arched bridge, which in turn superseded a 600-year-old stone-built medieval structure. This was preceded by a succession of timber bridges, the first of which was built by the Roman founders of London.

The current bridge stands at the western end of the Pool of London and is positioned 30 metres (98 ft) upstream from previous alignments. The approaches to the medieval bridge were marked by the church of St Magnus-the-Martyr on the northern bank and by Southwark Cathedral on the southern shore. Until Putney Bridge opened in 1729, London Bridge was the only road-crossing of the Thames downstream of Kingston upon Thames. London Bridge has been depicted in its several forms, in art, literature, and songs, including the nursery rhyme &quot;London Bridge Is Falling Down&quot;.

The modern bridge is owned and maintained by Bridge House Estates, an independent charity of medieval origin overseen by the City of London Corporation. It carries the A3 road, which is maintained by the Greater London Authority. The crossing also delineates an area along the southern bank of the River Thames, between London Bridge and Tower Bridge, that has been designated as a business improvement district.

Die London Bridge ist eine Straßenbrücke, die über den Fluss Themse in London führt. Sie verbindet die City of London auf der Nordseite mit dem Stadtteil Southwark im Stadtbezirk London Borough of Southwark auf der Südseite. Am südlichen Ufer stehen die Southwark Cathedral und der Bahnhof London Bridge, am nördlichen Ufer das Monument des Großen Brandes von London.

Bis zur Eröffnung der Westminster Bridge im Jahr 1750 war die (alte) London Bridge die einzige Brücke über die Themse im heutigen Stadtzentrum. Die heutige Brücke ist 283 m lang, 32 m breit und besteht aus drei vorgespannten Betonträgern. Darüber führt die sechsspurige Hauptstraße A3. Die London Bridge ist im Besitz von Bridge House Estates, einer Wohlfahrtsorganisation der City of London Corporation; der Unterhalt erfolgt jedoch durch die Greater London Authority.

It sits on Ludgate Hill at the highest point of the City of London. Its dedication to Paul the Apostle dates back to the original church on this site, founded in AD 604. The present church, dating from the late 17th century, was designed in the English Baroque style by Sir Christopher Wren. Its construction, completed in Wren's lifetime, was part of a major rebuilding programme in the City after the Great Fire of London

The cathedral is one of the most famous and most recognisable sights of London. Its dome, framed by the spires of Wren's City churches, dominated the skyline for 300 years.  At 365 feet (111 m) high, it was the tallest building in London from 1710 to 1962. The dome is among the highest in the world. St Paul's is the second largest church building in area in the United Kingdom after Liverpool Cathedral.

St Paul's Cathedral occupies a significant place in the national identity. It is the central subject of much promotional material, as well as of images of the dome surrounded by the smoke and fire of the Blitz. Services held at St Paul's have included the funerals of Lord Nelson, the Duke of Wellington and Sir Winston Churchill; Jubilee celebrations for Queen Victoria; peace services marking the end of the First and Second World Wars; the wedding of Charles, Prince of Wales and Lady Diana Spencer, the launch of the Festival of Britain and the thanksgiving services for the Golden Jubilee, the 80th Birthday and the Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II.

St Paul's Cathedral is a working church with hourly prayer and daily services.

Il London Eye è una gigantesca ruota panoramica situata sulle rive del Tamigi, a Londra, Inghilterra. L'intera struttura è alta 135 metri di altezza e ha un diametro di 120 metri. E 'la più alta ruota panoramica d'Europa, e la più popolare attrazione turistica pagato nel Regno Unito, visitata da oltre 3,5 milioni di persone ogni anno. Quando fu eretta nel 1999, era la più alta ruota panoramica del mondo, superata poi dalla Stella di Nanchang,  nel 2006, alta 160 metri, e successivamente dalla Singapore Flyer, nel 2008, alta 165 metri. La ruota, alimentata da motori elettrici,  è composta da 32 capsule ovoidali sigillate e climatizzate, attaccate alla circonferenza esterna. Ogni capsula rappresenta uno dei  quartieri di Londra, pesa 10 tonnellate e contiene 25 persone, che sono libere di muoversi all'interno della capsula. La ruota gira a 26 cm al secondo (circa 0,9 km / h) in modo che una rotazione avviene in circa 30 minuti. Non deve generalmente fermarsi per raccogliere i passeggeri in quanto il tasso di rotazione è abbastanza lento per consentire ai passeggeri di camminare dentro e fuori le capsule in movimento a livello del suolo.

The London Eye is a giant Ferris wheel situated on the banks of the River Thames, in London, England. The entire structure is 135 metres tall and the wheel has a diameter of 120 metres. It is the tallest Ferris wheel in Europe, and the most popular paid tourist attraction in the United Kingdom, visited by over 3.5 million people annually. When erected in 1999, it was the tallest Ferris wheel in the world, until surpassed first by the 160 metres Star of Nanchang in 2006, and then the 165 metres Singapore Flyer in 2008.  The wheel's 32 sealed and air-conditioned ovoidal passenger capsules are attached to the external circumference of the wheel and rotated by electric motors. Each capsule represents one of the London Boroughs, weighs 10 tonnes and holds 25 people, who are free to walk around inside the capsule. The wheel rotates at 26 cm per second (about 0.9 km/h) so that one revolution takes about 30 minutes. It does not usually stop to take on passengers; the rotation rate is slow enough to allow passengers to walk on and off the moving capsules at ground level.

The Royal Observatory, Greenwich (ROG; known as the Old Royal Observatory from 1957 to 1998, when the working Royal Greenwich Observatory, RGO, moved from Greenwich to Herstmonceux) is an observatory situated on a hill in Greenwich Park, overlooking the River Thames. It played a major role in the history of astronomy and navigation, and is best known for the fact that the prime meridian passes through it, and thereby gave its name to Greenwich Mean Time. The ROG has the IAU observatory code of 000, the first in the list. ROG, the National Maritime Museum, the Queen's House and Cutty Sark are collectively designated Royal Museums Greenwich.

The observatory was commissioned in 1675 by King Charles II, with the foundation stone being laid on 10 August. The site was chosen by Sir Christopher Wren. At that time the king also created the position of Astronomer Royal, to serve as the director of the observatory and to &quot;apply himself with the most exact care and diligence to the rectifying of the tables of the motions of the heavens, and the places of the fixed stars, so as to find out the so much desired longitude of places for the perfecting of the art of navigation.&quot; He appointed John Flamsteed as the first Astronomer Royal. The building was completed in the summer of 1676. The building was often called &quot;Flamsteed House&quot;, in reference to its first occupant.

The scientific work of the observatory was relocated elsewhere in stages in the first half of the 20th century, and the Greenwich site is now maintained almost exclusively as a museum, although the AMAT telescope became operational for astronomical research in 2018.

British astronomers have long used the Royal Observatory as a basis for measurement. Four separate meridians have passed through the buildings, defined by successive instruments. The basis of longitude, the meridian that passes through the Airy transit circle, first used in 1851, was adopted as the world's Prime Meridian at the International Meridian Conference on 22 October 1884 (voting took place on 13 October). Subsequently, nations across the world used it as their standard for mapping and timekeeping. The Prime Meridian was marked by a brass (later replaced by stainless steel) strip in the Observatory's courtyard once the buildings became a museum in 1960, and, since 16 December 1999, has been marked by a powerful green laser shining north across the London night sky.

Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) was until 1954 based on celestial observations made at Greenwich, and later on observations made at other observatories. GMT was formally renamed as Universal Time in 1935, but is still commonly referred to as GMT. It is now calculated from observations of extra-galactic radio sources.

To help mariners at the port and others in line of sight of the observatory to synchronise their clocks to GMT, Astronomer Royal John Pond installed a very visible time ball that drops precisely at 1 p.m. (13:00) every day atop the observatory in 1833. Initially it was dropped by an operator; from 1852 it was released automatically via an electric impulse from the Shepherd Master Clock. The ball is still dropped daily at 13:00 (GMT in winter, BST in summer).

The observatory buildings at Greenwich became a museum of astronomical and navigational tools, which is part of the Royal Museums Greenwich. Notable exhibits include John Harrison's sea watch, the H4, which received a large reward from the Board of Longitude, and his three earlier marine timekeepers; all four are the property of the Ministry of Defence. Many additional horological artefacts are displayed, documenting the history of precision timekeeping for navigational and astronomical purposes, including the mid-20th-century Russian-made F.M. Fedchenko clock (the most accurate pendulum clock ever built in multiple copies). It also houses the astronomical instruments used to make meridian observations and the 28-inch equatorial Grubb refracting telescope of 1893, the largest of its kind in the UK. The Shepherd Clock outside the observatory gate is an early example of an electric slave clock.

In February 2005 a £16 million redevelopment comprising a new planetarium and additional display galleries and educational facilities was started; the ROG reopened on 25 May 2007 with the new 120-seat Peter Harrison Planetarium.

Das Royal Greenwich Observatory (RGO; deutsch Königliches Observatorium von Greenwich), das als Arbeitsplatz für die königlichen Hofastronomen erbaut wurde, lag ursprünglich auf einem Hügel im Greenwich Park in Greenwich, London, von wo aus man die Themse sehen kann. Das Observatorium, genaugenommen der Mittelpunkt des Teleskops im Observatorium, wurde als Bezug für die Festlegung des Nullmeridians und somit der Längengrade genutzt. Er wird im Innenhof durch einen Messingstreifen markiert. Seit dem 16. Dezember 1999 beleuchtet die Linie ein starker grüner Laser, der nach Norden durch London und Essex in der Nacht leuchtet.

Das Observatorium wurde am 22. Juni 1675 von König Karl II. von England gegründet und der Bau wurde von John Flamsteed in Auftrag gegeben. Das Flamsteed House (1675–76), der ursprüngliche Teil des Observatoriums, wurde von Sir Christopher Wren entworfen und auf den Fundamenten einer Burg errichtet. Es ist nach dem Observatorium in Paris das zweitälteste seiner Art in Europa.

Im Jahre 1948 zog das Royal Greenwich Observatory nach Herstmonceux, nahe Hailsham in East Sussex, um klarere Nächte bei der Beobachtung zu haben. Das Isaac Newton Telescope wurde dort 1967 gebaut, wurde aber 1979 in das Roque-de-los-Muchachos-Observatorium auf La Palma, Spanien gebracht. 1990 zog das Royal Greenwich Observatory erneut um, diesmal nach Cambridge. Nach einer Entscheidung des Particle Physics and Astronomy Research Council wurde es 1998 geschlossen. Das HM Nautical Almanac Office wurde nach der Schließung ins Rutherford Appleton Laboratory verlegt. Andere Forschungsarbeiten wurden ins UK Astronomy Technology Centre in Edinburgh gebracht.

Seit 1995 befinden sich das internationale Studienzentrum der Queen's University, Kingston, Kanada und das Observatory Science Centre in Herstmonceux Castle.

Die Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) war ehemals die Zeit, die am Observatorium in Greenwich gemessen wurde, bevor sie von der Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) abgelöst wurde. Obwohl es in Greenwich kein aktives astronomisches Observatorium mehr gibt, bleibt es ein Zentrum moderner Astronomie.

Auf dem Dach der Sternwarte wurde vom Hofastronomen John Pond im Jahre 1833 die lederbezogene Zeitkugel installiert. Diese wird auch heute noch täglich hochgezogen und fällt um Punkt 13 Uhr (14 Uhr MEZ; im Sommer um 13 Uhr Sommerzeit, 14 Uhr MESZ) herunter. Damit konnten früher die Schiffe auf der Themse ihre Schiffschronometer auf die exakte Greenwich Mean Time einstellen. Am 6. Dezember 1855 wurde bei einem Sturm die Zeitkugel heruntergerissen. Im Jahre 1919 wurde die lederne Zeitkugel durch die heutige rote Kugel aus Aluminium ersetzt.

Heute gibt es in der Sternwarte ein Museum für Astronomie- und Navigationswerkzeuge. Weiterhin wird auf die Entwicklung der Zeitmessung vom Mittelalter bis zur Moderne eingegangen. Die Ausstellung zeigt den Zusammenhang zwischen Zeitmessung und weltweiter Positionsbestimmung anhand der Sonne und der Sterne. Ein besonderes Ausstellungsstück ist das erste Replikat des Längenchronometers H1 von John Harrison (die Originale H1 bis H4 sind im benachbarten National Maritime Museum ausgestellt). Zudem ist eine Besichtigung der Privatwohnung des Astronomen John Flamsteed möglich. Im rechten Torpfeiler des Eingangsportals ist die Shepherd Gate Clock eingebaut.

Vom Museumshügel bietet sich eine Aussicht auf London, insbesondere auf die Docklands, die Hochhäuser von Canary Wharf und den Millennium Dome. Zudem ist eine Besteigung des Turms der Sternwarte möglich.

Die heute gebräuchlichen globalen Koordinatensysteme sind durch viele Fundamentalstationen statt nur durch eine definiert (siehe ITRS). Der Referenzmeridian dieser Systeme, z. B. WGS 84, läuft etwa 100 Meter östlich am Observatorium vorbei.

The Tower of London, officially Her Majesty's Royal Palace and Fortress of the Tower of London, is a historic castle located on the north bank of the River Thames in central London. It lies within the London Borough of Tower Hamlets, separated from the eastern edge of the square mile of the City of London by the open space known as Tower Hill. It was founded towards the end of 1066 as part of the Norman Conquest of England. The White Tower, which gives the entire castle its name, was built by William the Conqueror in 1078 and was a resented symbol of oppression, inflicted upon London by the new ruling elite. The castle was used as a prison from 1100 (Ranulf Flambard) until 1952 (Kray twins), although that was not its primary purpose. A grand palace early in its history, it served as a royal residence. As a whole, the Tower is a complex of several buildings set within two concentric rings of defensive walls and a moat. There were several phases of expansion, mainly under Kings Richard I, Henry III, and Edward I in the 12th and 13th centuries. The general layout established by the late 13th century remains despite later activity on the site.

The Tower of London has played a prominent role in English history. It was besieged several times, and controlling it has been important to controlling the country. The Tower has served variously as an armoury, a treasury, a menagerie, the home of the Royal Mint, a public record office, and the home of the Crown Jewels of England. From the early 14th century until the reign of Charles II, a procession would be led from the Tower to Westminster Abbey on the coronation of a monarch. In the absence of the monarch, the Constable of the Tower is in charge of the castle. This was a powerful and trusted position in the medieval period. In the late 15th century, the castle was the prison of the Princes in the Tower. Under the Tudors, the Tower became used less as a royal residence, and despite attempts to refortify and repair the castle, its defences lagged behind developments to deal with artillery.

The peak period of the castle's use as a prison was the 16th and 17th centuries, when many figures who had fallen into disgrace, such as Elizabeth I before she became queen, Sir Walter Raleigh, and Elizabeth Throckmorton, were held within its walls. This use has led to the phrase &quot;sent to the Tower&quot;. Despite its enduring reputation as a place of torture and death, popularised by 16th-century religious propagandists and 19th-century writers, only seven people were executed within the Tower before the World Wars of the 20th century. Executions were more commonly held on the notorious Tower Hill to the north of the castle, with 112 occurring there over a 400-year period. In the latter half of the 19th century, institutions such as the Royal Mint moved out of the castle to other locations, leaving many buildings empty. Anthony Salvin and John Taylor took the opportunity to restore the Tower to what was felt to be its medieval appearance, clearing out many of the vacant post-medieval structures. In the First and Second World Wars, the Tower was again used as a prison and witnessed the executions of 12 men for espionage. After the Second World War, damage caused during the Blitz was repaired, and the castle reopened to the public. Today, the Tower of London is one of the country's most popular tourist attractions. Under the ceremonial charge of the Constable of the Tower, and operated by the Resident Governor of the Tower of London and Keeper of the Jewel House, the property is cared for by the charity Historic Royal Palaces and is protected as a World Heritage Site.

Her Majesty’s Royal Palace and Fortress of the Tower of London ist ein befestigter Gebäudekomplex entlang der Themse am südöstlichen Ende der City of London. Die Ringburg mit zwei Festungsringen diente den englischen und britischen Königen unter anderem als Residenz, Waffenkammer, Werkstatt, Lager, Zoo, Garnison, Museum, Münzprägestätte, Gefängnis, Archiv und Hinrichtungsstätte. Seit 600 Jahren wird der Tower von Touristen besucht. Im Jahr 2011 war er mit mehr als 2,5 Millionen Besuchern die meistbesuchte kostenpflichtige Attraktion im Vereinigten Königreich.

Ursprünglich wurde der Tower im 11. Jahrhundert als Festung Wilhelms des Eroberers gegen die potentiell feindseligen Bürger der Stadt London errichtet. Bis zu Jakob I. nutzten alle englischen Könige den Tower zeitweilig zum Aufenthalt. Als Stützpunkt der britischen Monarchie im historischen Zentrum Londons ist der Tower eng mit der britischen Geschichte verbunden. Die Außenmauern und Türme des Towers wurden im Wesentlichen im Mittelalter errichtet. In den folgenden Jahrhunderten wurden zahlreiche An- und Umbauten innerhalb der Mauern durchgeführt. Im 19. Jahrhundert erfolgte eine Neugestaltung: Mauern und Türme wurden in neugotischem Stil neu errichtet, Gebäude innerhalb der Mauern abgerissen.

Heute beherbergt der Tower Ausstellungen über das Gebäude selbst und seine Geschichte, Teile der Sammlung der Royal Armouries, die britischen Kronjuwelen, das Hauptquartier und das Museum des Royal Regiment of Fusiliers, Wohnräume für die Yeoman Warders sowie Verwaltungs- und Büroräume. Aus dem Tower gingen das Board of Ordnance, die Royal Mint, der Ordnance Survey, das Royal Observatory, das Public Record Office und der London Zoo hervor. Der Tower ist Handlungsort zahlreicher Dramen und Romane von Shakespeare bis Edgar Wallace. Insbesondere Schriften und Historiengemälde des 19. Jahrhunderts betonen die Rolle als Gefängnis und trugen maßgeblich zur Rezeption des Towers als düsterem Kerker bei.

Die UNESCO erklärte den Tower 1988 zum Weltkulturerbe. Der Tower gehört der britischen Krone und wird von den Historic Royal Palaces verwaltet.

I was originally enrolled as a SHUTTERSTOCK contributor on January 28th 2019. Shutterstock is an American stock photography company with headquarters in New York City, founded in 2003 by Photographer Jon Oringer. With a library in excess of 200 milliuon royalty free stock photographs, I am delighted, and most grateful to have been accepted into the fold.

Having been passionate about photography since the age of seven years old, with a box brownie and black and white 120 roll film, these days I take a far more leisurely approach to my photographic exploits, a Nikon D850 FX Pro body as my trusted companion, I travel light with less constraints and more emphasis on the pure capture of the beauty that I see, more akin to my original persuits and goals some five decades previously when starting out. I would like to say a huge and heartfelt 'THANK YOU' to GETTY IMAGES, SHUTTERSTOCK, and the 27.302+ Million visitors to my FLICKR site. 


***** Selected for sale in the SHUTTERSTOCK COMMERCIAL COLLECTION Image ID:1301149735 on February 1st 2019.


This photograph became my 12th frame to be selected for sale on SHUTTERSTOCK, and I am very grateful to them for this wonderful opportunity.

A Southeastern Network train from Bexleyheath to London Bridge Station at 06:01am this morning, and despite the BBC weather centre assuring me of heavy cloud and light rain, Londoners were treated to a rather spectacular and beautiful sunrise this morning.

Photograph taken at an altitude of Fourteen metres at 07:47am on Thursday 22nd October 2015, off Bankside on London's South Bank,  from the first intersection on  The Millennium Bridge, officially known as the London Millennium Footbridge, which was designed by Norman Foster, and was constructed between 1996 and 2000.


 It is a steel suspension bridge for pedestrians crossing the River Thames in London, linking Bankside with the City of London. I affectionately call the Bridge, 'The wibbly-wobbly bridge', after somewhat embarassing teething problems which had the old girl flexing in her moorings when first opened. This view looks towards Monument, Tower Bridge and HMS Belfast moored on the River Thames.  The mighty Shard is on the right of the frame.

The gate was built by Edward I (1239-1307), to provide a water gate entrance to the Tower, part of St. Thomas's Tower, which was designed to provide additional accommodation for the royal family.

In the pool behind Traitors' Gate was an engine that was used for raising water to a cistern on the roof of the White Tower. The engine worked originally by the force of the tide or by horsepower and eventually by steam. In 1724–6, it was adapted to drive machinery for boring gun barrels. It was removed in the 1860s.[citation needed]

The name Traitors' Gate has been used since before 1543, when that name is used on Anton van den Wyngaerde's panorama of London. Prisoners were brought by barge along the Thames, passing under London Bridge, where the heads of recently executed prisoners were displayed on pikes. Notable prisoners such as Sir Thomas More entered the Tower by Traitors' Gate.&quot;

Brick Lane (Bengali: ব্রিক লেন) is a street in the East End of London, in the Borough of Tower Hamlets. It runs from Swanfield Street in Bethnal Green, crosses Bethnal Green Road in Shoreditch, enters Whitechapel and is linked to Whitechapel High Street to the south by the short stretch of Osborn Street. Today, it is the heart of the city's Bangladeshi community and is known to some as Banglatown. It is famous for its many curry houses.

Winding through fields, the street was formerly called Whitechapel Lane. It derives its current name from brick and tile manufacture started in the 15th century, which used the local brick earth deposits.[2] and featured in the 16th century Woodcut map of London as a partially-developed crossroad leading north from the city's most easterly edge. By the 17th century, the street was being developed northwards from the Barres (now Whitechapel High Street) as a result of expanding population.

Brewing came to Brick Lane before 1680, with water drawn from deep wells. One brewer was Joseph Truman, first recorded in 1683. His family, particularly Benjamin Truman, went on to establish the sizeable Black Eagle Brewery on Brick Lane. The Brick Lane Market first developed in the 17th century for fruit and vegetables sold outside the City.

Successive waves of immigrants settled in the area: in the 17th century, French Huguenots expanded into the area for housing; the master weavers were based in Spitalfields. Starting with the Huguenots, the area became a centre for weaving, tailoring and the developing clothing industry. It continued to attract immigrants, who provided semi- and unskilled labour.

In the 19th century, Irish people and Ashkenazi Jews immigrated to the area. Jewish immigration continued into the early 20th century.

The Sunday market, like the ones on Petticoat Lane and nearby Columbia Road, dates from a dispensation given by the government to the Jewish community in the 19th century. At the time, there were no Sunday markets open because of the Christian observance of Sabbath. Located at the junction of Cheshire and Sclater streets, the market sells bric-a-brac as well as fruit, vegetables and many other items. In 2015 it was identified by police as the focal point of a trade in stolen bicycles and bicycle parts, many taken from City of London employees who had used &quot;cycle to work&quot; schemes. Alongside seven arrests, the police also warned purchasers that buying bicycles or parts in deals &quot;too good to be true&quot; could make them guilty of handling stolen goods. Near the junction with Hanbury Street are two indoor markets; Upmarket and Backyard Market. In 2010, the Brick Lane Farmers' Market opened, intended to be held every Sunday in nearby Bacon Street; it has now closed.

In the later 20th century, Bangladeshis comprised the major group of immigrants and gradually predominated in the area. Many Bangladeshi immigrants to Brick Lane were from the Greater Sylhet region. These settlers helped shape Bangladeshi migration to Britain; many families from Jagannathpur and Bishwanath tend to live in the Brick Lane area.

In 1742, La Neuve Eglise, a Huguenot chapel, was built on the corner of Brick Lane and Fournier Street. By 1809, it was used by missionaries as The Jews’ Chapel, where they promoted Christianity to the expanding Jewish population. It was adapted as a Methodist Chapel in 1819 for Protestant residents. (John Wesley had preached his first &quot;covenant sermon&quot; at the nearby Black Eagle Street Chapel).

Reflecting the changing demographics of the area, in 1898, the building was consecrated as the Machzikei HaDath, or Spitalfields Great Synagogue. After decades of change in the area, with Jews moving out and Bangladeshis moving in, in 1976 it was adapted again as the London Jamme Masjid (Great London Mosque) to serve the expanding Bangladeshi community. The building is Grade II* listed.

In the 20th century the Brick Lane area was important in the second wave of development of Anglo-Indian cuisine, as families from countries such as Bangladesh (mainly the Greater Sylhet region) migrated to London to look for work. Some curry houses of Brick Lane do not sell alcohol as most are owned by Muslims.

Bengalis in the United Kingdom settled in big cities with industrial employment. In London, many Bengali people settled in the East End. For centuries the East End has been the first port of call for many immigrants working in the docks and shipping from Chittagong port in Bengal (British Empire in India was founded and based in Bengal). Their regular stopover paved the way for food/curry outlets to be opened up catering for an all-male workforce as family migration and settlement took place some decades later. Humble beginnings such as this gave birth to Brick Lane as the famous curry capital of the UK. Bengalis of Sylheti origin constitute only 10% of all South Asians in Britain; however around 90% of all South Asian restaurants in the UK are Sylheti- or Bengali-owned.

More recently the area has also broadened to being a vibrant art and fashion student area, with considerable exhibition space. Each year most of the fine art and fashion courses exhibit their work near Brick Lane.

Since the late 1990s, Brick Lane has been the site of several of the city's best known night clubs, notably 93 Feet East and The Vibe Bar, both built on the site of The Old Truman Brewery, once the industrial centre of the area, and now an office and entertainment complex. In 1999, it was the scene of a bombing that injured 13 people.

Brick Lane has a regular display of graffiti, which features artists such as Banksy, Stik, ROA, D*Face, Ben Eine and Omar Hassan. The lane has been used in many music videos such as &quot;Glory Days&quot; by Just Jack, &quot;All These Things That I've Done&quot; by The Killers and &quot;Überlin&quot; by R.E.M..

Die Brick Lane (Bengali: ব্রিক লেন) ist eine Straße im Londoner Stadtbezirk Tower Hamlets. Sie führt von Bethnal Green im Norden durch Spitalfields bis Whitechapel im Süden und ist eine der bekanntesten Straßen des Londoner East Ends. Die Straße gilt als das Herz der Bangladeschi-Gemeinde Londons und ist unter anderem für ihre zahlreichen südasiatischen Restaurants und ihren Straßenmarkt bekannt. Straße und Straßenmarkt gelten heute als Londoner Touristenattraktion.

Die Brick Lane ist rund einen Kilometer lang und größtenteils nur in eine Richtung befahrbar.

Ursprünglich trug die Straße den Namen Whitechapel Lane und verlief in einer ländlichen Gegend. Ihr heutiger Name bezieht sich auf die Backstein-Produktion, die seit dem 15. Jahrhundert den lokalen Ziegellehm verarbeitete. Im 17. Jahrhundert entwickelte sich die Straße aufgrund des Bevölkerungszuwachses zu einem Wohngebiet. Zahlreiche Einwanderer ließen sich in der Gegend nieder, so zunächst französische Hugenotten. In dieser Zeit entwickelte sich der Stadtteil zu einem Zentrum des Weberhandwerks, der Schneiderei und Bekleidungsherstellung.

Im 19. Jahrhundert ließen sich zunehmend irische Immigranten und aschkenasische Juden in der Brick Lane nieder. Zu Beginn des 20. Jahrhunderts erhöhte sich die Zahl der Juden durch eine neue Einwanderungswelle. Im späten 20. Jahrhundert kam eine neue Gruppe von Einwanderern aus Bangladesch hinzu, die die Straße inzwischen dominiert und prägt.

1742 erbauten die Hugenotten La Neuve Eglise, eine protestantische Kirche, an der Ecke Brick Lane und Fournier Street. Ab 1809 wurde sie von Missionaren als The Jews’ Chapel zur Missionierung der wachsenden jüdischen Bevölkerung genutzt. Von 1819 an diente sie der methodistischen Gemeinde als Kirche, ab 1898 war sie unter dem Namen Machzikei HaDath Synagoge. Nach dem Zuzug zahlreicher Bangladesher dient sie seit 1976 unter dem Namen London Jamme Masjid als Moschee. Das Gebäude steht unter Denkmalschutz (Grade II* listed).

The Old Royal Naval College is the architectural centrepiece of Maritime Greenwich, a World Heritage Site in Greenwich, London, described by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) as being of &quot;outstanding universal value&quot; and reckoned to be the &quot;finest and most dramatically sited architectural and landscape ensemble in the British Isles&quot;. The site is managed by the Greenwich Foundation for the Old Royal Naval College, set up in July 1998 as a registered charity to &quot;look after these magnificent buildings and their grounds for the benefit of the nation&quot;. The grounds and some of its buildings are open to visitors. The buildings were originally constructed to serve as the Royal Hospital for Seamen at Greenwich, now generally known as Greenwich Hospital, which was designed by Christopher Wren, and built between 1696 and 1712. The hospital closed in 1869. Between 1873 and 1998 it was the Royal Naval College, Greenwich.

This was originally the site of the Palace of Placentia, more commonly known as Greenwich Palace, the birthplace of Tudor queens Mary I and Elizabeth I and reputedly the favourite palace of Henry VIII. The palace had fallen into disrepair during the English Civil War. With the exception of the incomplete John Webb building, the palace was finally demolished in 1694.

In 1692 the Royal Hospital for Seamen at Greenwich was created on the site on the instructions of Mary II, who had been inspired by the sight of wounded sailors returning from the Battle of La Hogue. Architectural highlights included the Chapel and the Painted Hall. The Painted Hall was painted between 1707-1726 by Sir James Thornhill. The hospital closed in 1869 and the remains of thousands of sailors and officers were removed from the hospital site in 1875 and reinterred in East Greenwich Pleasaunce or &quot;Pleasaunce Park&quot;.

In 1873, four years after the hospital closed, the buildings were converted to a training establishment for the Royal Navy. The Royal Navy finally left the College in 1998 when the site passed into the hands of the Greenwich Foundation for the Old Royal Naval College.

Das (Old) Royal Naval College in Greenwich zählt zu den bedeutendsten Barockbauwerken in England und gehört seit 1997 zum UNESCO-Welterbe.

Nach der Stuart-Restauration plante Karl II. in Greenwich den Bau eines neuen königlichen Palastes anstelle des alten Palace of Placentia. Bis 1669 wurden jedoch nur der königliche Park angelegt und ein von John Webb entworfener Seitenflügel fertiggestellt, bevor der Bau aus finanziellen Gründen eingestellt wurde. Erst unter Wilhelm III. wurden die Baupläne wieder aufgegriffen. Da die Lage für die Gesundheit des an Asthma leidenden Königs nicht zuträglich war, entschlossen sich der König und Königin Maria unter dem Eindruck des englischen Seesiegs bei La Hougue und nach dem Vorbild des Hôtel des Invalides in Paris und des kurz vorher fertiggestellten Royal Hospital in Chelsea, anstelle eines Palastes ein Marinehospital für alte und verwundete Seeleute zu bauen. Die Entwürfe für das Royal Hospital for Seamen at Greenwich, gewöhnlich nur Greenwich Hospital genannt, lieferten Christopher Wren und sein Assistent Nicholas Hawksmoor ohne Bezahlung. Die Bauzeit an dem Komplex erstreckte sich über mehr als 30 Jahre, neben Wren und Hawksmoor arbeiteten die Architekten Campbell, Vanbrugh und Ripley an der Anlage. Die Kapelle wurde erst 1752 vollendet, doch die ersten Pensionäre zogen bereits 1705 ein. Gegen Ende des 18. Jahrhunderts lebten etwa 2000 Pensionäre in der Anlage. 

In der Painted Hall, dem Speisesaal des Hospitals, lag 1805 der Leichnam Nelsons aufgebahrt. Vom Hospital wurde der Leichnam in einer offenen Staatsbarkasse, von einer prachtvollen Schiffsprozession begleitet, zur Grabstätte in die St Paul’s Cathedral überführt. Wegen Misswirtschaft und Korruption zogen im 19. Jahrhundert viele Pensionäre fort, 1869 wurde das Hospital geschlossen. Von 1873 bis 1998 dienten die Gebäude als Royal Naval College, das aus Portsmouth hierher verlegt wurde. Heute dienen die Gebäude der Universität Greenwich, im King Charles Court befindet sich das Trinity College of Music. Die Painted Hall und die Kapelle sind zu besichtigen, im nordwestlichen Gebäude ist ein Besucherzentrum. Seit 1997 gehören die Gebäude als Teil von Maritime Greenwich zum Weltkulturerbe der UNESCO.

Beim Entwurf der Anlage bestand Königin Maria darauf, dass entgegen dem ursprünglichen Entwurf von John Webb das rückwärtig gelegene Queen’s House sichtbar bleiben und dieses in die zentrale Blickachse mit eingezogen werden müsse. Wren entschied sich, vier symmetrisch zur Mittelachse orientierte Bauten zu errichten, die jeweils einen Innenhof umschließen. Dabei bezog er den bis 1669 als Seitenflügel des neuen Königspalastes errichteten Bau mit ein. Diesem King Charles Court genannten Bau gegenüber entstand bis 1729 der Queen Anne Court. Die beiden rückwärtigen Bauten werden als King William Court und Queen Mary Court bezeichnet. Die perspektivisch eingerückten Zwillingsbauten setzen mit ihren Kuppeln optische Akzente und geben den Blick auf das Queen’s House frei. 

In dem westlich gelegenen King William Court befindet sich die Painted Hall, die ursprünglich als Speisesaal der Pensionäre geplant war. Der Saal besteht mit Vestibül, Lower und Upper Hall aus drei verschiedenen Ebenen und gilt mit seiner Wand- und Deckenbemalung als Höhepunkt der englischen Barockmalerei. Die Malereien stammen von James Thornhill, der allein an dem Deckengemälde Der Triumph der protestantischen Thronfolge 20 Jahre lang gearbeitet hat. 

Das Gegenstück zur Painted Hall ist die Kapelle im Queen Mary Court. Nach einem Entwurf von Wren wurde sie erst 1752 von Thomas Ripley fertiggestellt. Nachdem sie 1772 ausgebrannt war, wurde sie bis 1779 von James „Athenian“ Stuart neu gestaltet. Der klassizistisch ausgestattete Raum ist für seine gute Akustik bekannt.

The standard is “A very high standard of imaging that would be appropriate for National and International levels, demonstrating an understanding of what constitutes good photography, including camera technique, composition and     design, presentation and finish and an empathy with the subject matter.” 

I love the London Underground so thought that would be my theme. After various iterations, I decided to go for a mono panel showing more architecture than anything else. You'll also notice a distinct lack of people. 

I spent a number of weekends in London getting up at ridiculously early hours and equally late hours. 

You are not allowed any sort of camera support (tripod or monopod etc.) anywhere within the underground system so all shots are hand held.

Another issue was the low light levels, hence a higher ISO and a slower shutter speed than I really wanted to use. 

Out of a few thousand images, these are my final 12.

I also had to provide a hanging plan as to how I wanted my panel to be presented.

You will note that I have portrait format stairs/escalators at the start/end of each row to allow the viewer to move up and down the rows.

I was a bundle of nerves - and I happened to be the last print panel to be judged (out of 21 panels) which didn't help. I was delighted when the judges announced that I had been successful!

In the photographic world, I am now entitled to use the letters AWPF after my name :-)

The Victoria and Albert Museum (often abbreviated as the V&amp;A) in London is the world's largest museum of decorative arts and design, housing a permanent collection of over 2.27 million objects. It was founded in 1852 and named after Queen Victoria and Prince Albert.

The V&amp;A is located in the Brompton district of the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, in an area that has become known as &quot;Albertopolis&quot; because of its association with Prince Albert, the Albert Memorial and the major cultural institutions with which he was associated. These include the Natural History Museum, the Science Museum and the Royal Albert Hall. The museum is a non-departmental public body sponsored by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport. Like other national British museums, entrance to the museum has been free since 2001.

The V&amp;A covers 12.5 acres (5.1 ha) and 145 galleries. Its collection spans 5,000 years of art, from ancient times to the present day, from the cultures of Europe, North America, Asia and North Africa. The holdings of ceramics, glass, textiles, costumes, silver, ironwork, jewellery, furniture, medieval objects, sculpture, prints and printmaking, drawings and photographs are among the largest and most comprehensive in the world.

The museum owns the world's largest collection of post-classical sculpture, with the holdings of Italian Renaissance items being the largest outside Italy. The departments of Asia include art from South Asia, China, Japan, Korea and the Islamic world. The East Asian collections are among the best in Europe, with particular strengths in ceramics and metalwork, while the Islamic collection is amongst the largest in the Western world. Overall, it is one of the largest museums in the world.

Since 2001, the museum has embarked on a major £150m renovation programme, which has seen a major overhaul of the departments, including the introduction of newer galleries, gardens, shops and visitor facilities.

New 17th- and 18th-century European galleries were opened on 9 December 2015. These restored the original Aston Webb interiors and host the European collections 1600–1815.

Das Victoria and Albert Museum (oftmals abgekürzt V&amp;A), im Jahr 1852 unter der Bezeichnung South Kensington Museum gegründet, liegt an der Cromwell Road in Kensington, West London und beherbergt die größte Sammlung von Kunstgewerbe und Design der Welt. Es wurde 2013 von 3,2 Millionen Menschen besucht. Vom 1. September 2011 bis zum Herbst 2016 wurde es vom deutschen Kulturhistoriker Martin Roth geleitet. Zu seinem Nachfolger wurde im Januar 2017 der britische Politiker und Labour-Abgeordnete, promovierte Historiker und Journalist Tristram Hunt berufen, der am 20. Februar 2017 sein Amt antrat. 

Das Museum nahm als eine Sammlung von Gipsabgüssen, Gravuren und ein paar Exponaten der Weltausstellung 1851 seinen Anfang. Zusammen mit dem Kunstmäzen Henry Cole schuf Prinz Albert, der Gemahl Queen Victorias, dann ein Konzept für ein Museum, das die „Anwendung der Kunst im Handwerk“ zeigen sollte – als Vorbild für die britische Bevölkerung. Cole, dem ersten Direktor, schwebte ein Museum zu Design und Kunsthandwerk in einem kommerziellen Kontext vor, nicht Kunsthandwerk um des Kunsthandwerks willen. Diese Philosophie wird bis heute vertreten. Das bescheidene Museum mit den hochfliegenden Ideen war zuerst in ein paar Holzhütten untergebracht, dann in den sogenannten Brompton Boilers. Es wurde schnell größer. Studienobjekte für die Studenten wurden zusammengetragen, Schenkungen trafen ein: britische Malerei von John Sheepshanks, die Sammlung Bandinel mit Porzellan und Keramik und die Sammlung Gherardini mit Modellen und Skulpturen. Mehrere Räume wurden Stück für Stück angebaut, so dass der zentrale viereckige Hof samt Osthöfen entstand; die Galerien von Aston Webb wurden von 1899 bis 1909 an der Vorderfront ergänzt. Dennoch mussten später ganze Abteilungen ausziehen, um als Zweigstellen des Victoria &amp; Albert Museum oder unabhängige Museen anderswo zu eröffnen: das Science Museum etwa, das Bethnal Green Museum of Childhood und das Theatre Museum.

Im 20. Jahrhundert expandierte das Museum dann in den angrenzenden Henry Cole Wing. Geplant war zunächst ein aufsehenerregender neuer Flügel, The Spiral, nach Entwürfen von Daniel Libeskind. Der Neubau wurde in der Öffentlichkeit kontrovers diskutiert, da vielfach die Ansicht vertreten wurde, er füge sich nur unzureichend in den historischen Baukomplex ein. Für Unverständnis sorgten auch die immensen Baukosten in Höhe von 70 Mio Pfund, die größtenteils aus Mitteln der Staatlichen Lotterie bestritten werden sollten. Dennoch wurde 2001 mit den Vorbereitungen zur Bauausführung begonnen. 2004 stellte sich heraus, dass der Heritage Lottery Fund die erwarteten Gelder anderweitig zu verwenden gedachte. Da die Museumsleitung keine Möglichkeit sah, die Baukosten aus eigener Kraft aufzubringen, beschloss man schließlich, das Projekt aufzugeben.

2011 erhielt das Architekturbüro AL_A von Amanda Levete den Auftrag einen neuen Eingangsbereich des Museums zu planen. Der Neubau soll 2017 fertiggestellt werden und nach dem Sponsor Leonard Blavatnik benannt werden.

The Tower of London, officially Her Majesty's Royal Palace and Fortress of the Tower of London, is a historic castle located on the north bank of the River Thames in central London. It lies within the London Borough of Tower Hamlets, separated from the eastern edge of the square mile of the City of London by the open space known as Tower Hill. It was founded towards the end of 1066 as part of the Norman Conquest of England. The White Tower, which gives the entire castle its name, was built by William the Conqueror in 1078 and was a resented symbol of oppression, inflicted upon London by the new ruling elite. The castle was used as a prison from 1100 (Ranulf Flambard) until 1952 (Kray twins), although that was not its primary purpose. A grand palace early in its history, it served as a royal residence. As a whole, the Tower is a complex of several buildings set within two concentric rings of defensive walls and a moat. There were several phases of expansion, mainly under Kings Richard I, Henry III, and Edward I in the 12th and 13th centuries. The general layout established by the late 13th century remains despite later activity on the site.

The Tower of London has played a prominent role in English history. It was besieged several times, and controlling it has been important to controlling the country. The Tower has served variously as an armoury, a treasury, a menagerie, the home of the Royal Mint, a public record office, and the home of the Crown Jewels of England. From the early 14th century until the reign of Charles II, a procession would be led from the Tower to Westminster Abbey on the coronation of a monarch. In the absence of the monarch, the Constable of the Tower is in charge of the castle. This was a powerful and trusted position in the medieval period. In the late 15th century, the castle was the prison of the Princes in the Tower. Under the Tudors, the Tower became used less as a royal residence, and despite attempts to refortify and repair the castle, its defences lagged behind developments to deal with artillery.

The peak period of the castle's use as a prison was the 16th and 17th centuries, when many figures who had fallen into disgrace, such as Elizabeth I before she became queen, Sir Walter Raleigh, and Elizabeth Throckmorton, were held within its walls. This use has led to the phrase &quot;sent to the Tower&quot;. Despite its enduring reputation as a place of torture and death, popularised by 16th-century religious propagandists and 19th-century writers, only seven people were executed within the Tower before the World Wars of the 20th century. Executions were more commonly held on the notorious Tower Hill to the north of the castle, with 112 occurring there over a 400-year period. In the latter half of the 19th century, institutions such as the Royal Mint moved out of the castle to other locations, leaving many buildings empty. Anthony Salvin and John Taylor took the opportunity to restore the Tower to what was felt to be its medieval appearance, clearing out many of the vacant post-medieval structures. In the First and Second World Wars, the Tower was again used as a prison and witnessed the executions of 12 men for espionage. After the Second World War, damage caused during the Blitz was repaired, and the castle reopened to the public. Today, the Tower of London is one of the country's most popular tourist attractions. Under the ceremonial charge of the Constable of the Tower, it is cared for by the charity Historic Royal Palaces and is protected as a World Heritage Site.

Her Majesty’s Royal Palace and Fortress the Tower of London ist ein befestigter Gebäudekomplex entlang der Themse am südöstlichen Ende der City of London. Die Ringburg mit zwei Festungsringen diente den englischen und britischen Königen unter anderem als Residenz, Waffenkammer, Werkstatt, Lager, Zoo, Garnison, Museum, Münzprägestätte, Gefängnis, Archiv und Hinrichtungsstätte. Seit 600 Jahren wird der Tower von Touristen besucht. Im Jahr 2011 war er mit mehr als 2,5 Millionen Besuchern die meistbesuchte kostenpflichtige Attraktion im Vereinigten Königreich.

Ursprünglich wurde der Tower im 11. Jahrhundert als Festung Wilhelms des Eroberers gegen die potentiell feindseligen Bürger der Stadt London errichtet. Bis zu Jakob I. nutzten alle englischen Könige den Tower zeitweilig zum Aufenthalt. Als Stützpunkt der britischen Monarchie im historischen Zentrum Londons ist der Tower eng mit der britischen Geschichte verbunden. Die Außenmauern und Türme des Towers wurden im Wesentlichen im Mittelalter errichtet. In den folgenden Jahrhunderten wurden zahlreiche An- und Umbauten innerhalb der Mauern durchgeführt. Im 19. Jahrhundert erfolgte eine Neugestaltung: Mauern und Türme wurden in neugotischem Stil neu errichtet, Gebäude innerhalb der Mauern abgerissen.

Heute beherbergt der Tower Ausstellungen über das Gebäude selbst und seine Geschichte, Teile der Sammlung der Royal Armouries, die britischen Kronjuwelen, das Hauptquartier und das Museum des Royal Regiment of Fusiliers, Wohnräume für die Yeoman Warders sowie Verwaltungs- und Büroräume. Aus dem Tower gingen das Board of Ordnance, die Royal Mint, der Ordnance Survey, das Royal Observatory, das Public Record Office und der London Zoo hervor. Der Tower ist Handlungsort zahlreicher Dramen und Romane von Shakespeare bis Edgar Wallace. Insbesondere Schriften und Historiengemälde des 19.

I was originally enrolled into the GETTY IMAGES collection as a contributor on April 9th 2012, and when links with FLICKR were terminated in March 2014, I was retained and fortunate enough to be signed up via a second contract, both of which have proved to be successful with sales of my photographs all over the world now handled exclusively by them. 

 


On November 12th 2015 GETTY IMAGES unveiled plans for a new stills upload platform called ESP (Enterprise Submission Platform), to replace the existing 'Moment portal', and on November 13th I was invited to Beta test the new system prior to it being officially rolled out in December. ESP went live on Tuesday December 15th 2015 and has smoothed out the upload process considerably.


These days I take a far more leisurely approach to my photographic exploits, and having moved from professional Nikon equipment to consumer bodies and lenses, I travel light less constraints and more emphasis on the pure capture of the beauty that I see, more akin to my original persuits and goals some five decades previously when starting out. I would like to say a huge and heartfelt 'THANK YOU' to GETTY IMAGES, and the 22.835+ Million visitors to my FLICKR site. 


***** Selected for sale in the GETTY IMAGES COLLECTION on September 12th 2017


CREATIVE RF gty.im/840989102 MOMENT OPEN COLLECTION**


This photograph became my 3,009th frame to be selected for sale in the Getty Images collection and I am very grateful to them for this wonderful opportunity.

Photograph taken at an altitude of Thirteen metres,in the magic of the Golden hour around sunrise,  at 08:21am on Monday 28th December 2015, on a beautifully warm and sunny morning off Birdcage Walk and Horse Guards Road in the grounds of St James's Park. 


  Situated in the City Of Westminster, the Park spans twenty three Hectares and is the oldest of the Royal Parks of London, with a variety of visiting and nesting birds that include Ducks, Canada Geese and Pelicans.


Big Ben is a nickname given to The Great Bell of the clock at the North end of the Palace of Westminster. The actual tower was originally called the Clock Tower and subsequently renamed in 2012 as the Elizabeth Tower, renamed to celebrate the Diamond Jubilee of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II.


The tower was completed in 1858 and the Bell used nowadays and designed by Augustus Pugin,  was in fact a second casting made in 1858 due to the original one two years earlier being damaged beyond repair whilst being transported to the tower by sixteen horses.

42759995352,"133876835@N08","3",NA,"London - Camden Lock Market","The Camden markets are a number of adjoining large retail markets in Camden Town near the Hampstead Road Lock of the Regent's Canal (popularly referred to as Camden Lock), often collectively named &quot;Camden Market&quot; or &quot;Camden Lock&quot;. Among products sold on the stalls are crafts, clothing, bric-a-brac, and fast food. It is the fourth-most popular visitor attraction in London, attracting approximately 250,000 people each week.

A small local foodstuffs market has operated in Inverness Street in Camden Town since the beginning of the 20th century. From 1974 a small weekly crafts market that operated every Sunday near Camden Lock developed into a large complex of markets.[2] The markets, originally temporary stalls only, extended to a mixture of stalls and fixed premises. The traditional Inverness Street market started losing stalls once local supermarkets opened; by mid-2013 all the original stalls had gone, being replaced by stalls similar to those of the other markets, including fast food but not produce.

The markets originally operated on Sundays only, which continues to be the main trading day. Opening later extended to Saturdays for most of the market. A number of traders, mainly those in fixed premises, operate throughout the week, although the weekend remains the peak period.

In 2014, Israeli billionaire Teddy Sagi started buying property in the Camden Market area. By March 2015, having purchased the four most important of the six sections of the market, he announced plans to invest £300 million in developing the market area by 2018.

Camden Lock Market is situated by the Regent's Canal on a site formerly occupied by warehouses and other premises associated with the canal. By the early 1970s the canal trade had ceased and a northern urban motorway was planned that would cut through the site, making any major permanent redevelopment impossible, and in 1974 a temporary market was established. By 1976, when plans for the motorway were abandoned, the market had become a well known feature of Camden Town. Originally, the Lock was a market for crafts, occupying some outdoor areas by the canal and various existing buildings.

While the range of goods has since widened, with stalls selling books, new and second-hand clothing, and jewellery, the Lock retains its focus as the principal Camden market for crafts. There is a large selection of fast food stalls. In 1991 a three-storey indoor market hall designed by architect John Dickinson was opened on the site of the first outdoor market. In the style of the traditional 19th century industrial architecture and housing in the area, it is built of brick and cast iron. It attracted large numbers of visitors partly due to stalls being open on Sundays, when previous to the Sunday Trading Act 1994, shops were not permitted to operate on Sundays. On 28 February 1993, the Provisional IRA exploded a bomb hidden in a litter bin on Camden High Street near the market, shortly after lunchtime. The bomb injured 11 people.

From 2006, a large indoor market hall was constructed in a yard between the Camden Lock Market and the Stables Market that was previously used for open air stalls. In November 2007 a large part of the Stables Market was demolished as part of a long-term redevelopment plan for the area and rebuilt as a year-round permanent market area.

In 2016, Urban Markets Company acquired Camden Lock and paid between £300m and £400m for the one-acre site. The joint venture between the founders of Camden Lock and Millitarne Retail Resorts International, the retail developers, was financed by Brockton Capital, a real estate private equity fund. Camden Lock Market is set to have a £20 million makeover to transform it into a traditional arts and craft centre for Londoners. The Urban Market Company plans to double the enclosed area and increase trading space by 15,000 square feet.

Early on 10 July 2017, shortly after midnight, a large fire (cause currently unknown) occurred at the Camden Lock Market. At least 70 firefighters and 10 engines attended.

Als Camden Market wird eine Ansammlung von verschiedenen Märkten in und um die Camden High Street im Londoner Bezirk Camden Town bezeichnet. Sie bilden einen der bekanntesten und größten Märkte der Stadt und werden pro Woche von rund 500.000 Menschen besucht.

Der Markt besteht aus sechs benachbarten Marktbereichen:

Camden Lock Market, gegründet im Jahr 1974, 1991 wurde eine neue Markthalle eröffnet.

Stables Market im Norden des Areals. Er hat die größte Fläche von allen Teilbereichen; es werden vorwiegend Kleidungsstücke und Möbel angeboten. Gegen den Umbau des Marktes und die Ansiedlung von großen Modeketten hatten 2007 Anwohner und Londoner protestiert.

Camden Canal Market im Nordosten des Areals, direkt am Regent’s Canal. Der Markt wurde am 9. Februar 2008 durch ein Feuer verwüstet. Hierbei wurde auch das bei Prominenten beliebte Pub „The Hawley Arms“ schwer beschädigt.

Buck Street Market im Süden, in der Nähe der U-Bahn-Station Camden Town

Electric Ballroom in den Räumlichkeiten eines alten Clubs aus den 1930er Jahren, am Wochenende dient er als Club und an zwei Tagen in der Woche als Market. Im Electric Ballroom spielten Rockbands und Musiker wie Madness, Iggy Pop, U2 oder Sid Vicious.

Inverness Street in einer Seitenstraße der Camden High Street im Südwesten des Areals, wo zahlreiche Pubs und Bars angesiedelt sind.

Unmittelbar an die Märkte angrenzend haben sich mehrere Medienunternehmen niedergelassen. So haben dort unter anderem MTV, die Nachrichtenagentur AP, als auch der deutsche Sender RTL am Camden Markt ihre Studios. Der verheerende Brand im Februar 2008 war nicht der erste seiner Art. Bereits im Oktober 1980 fielen Teile des Marktes einem Feuer zum Opfer.

Im Mai 2009, über ein Jahr nach dem verheerenden Brand, öffnete der Camden Market mit über einhundert neuen Geschäften unter dem neuen Namen Camden Lock Village wieder seine Pforten.

Am 10. Juli 2017 brach kurz nach Mitternacht ein Feuer im Camden Lock Market aus. Über 70 Feuerwehrleute waren im Einsatz und konnten den Brand nach rund drei Stunden in den frühen Morgenstunden unter Kontrolle bringen.

The brief from The Royal Parks (TRP) was to fit in a much needed café with an outdoor seating area. Located opposite the Italian Gardens, dating from 1860 and next to the 1705 Queen Anne’s Alcove, there was a need for the new building to sit subtly amongst the more dominant features.

Working with David Morley Architects and TRP horticulturalists LUC helped to design the look and feel of the development, ensuring the style and quality were appropriate for the location. It was also important to consider the scale of the building and the effects on the setting of the adjacent structures to secure planning permission.

The redundant building was retained and reworked for the kitchen and serving area with a new brick and portland stone extension to the front and side proving space for seating. Bi-fold glass doors provide an excellent view out of the building in poor weather and can be opened up in fine conditions. Timber louvres above limit the amount of summer sun entering the building.
The cafe also features a living roof which includes wild flower planting, wood piles and bricks to provide habitats for local wildlife. Bat boxes have been added to selected external walls.

The new hard landscape includes a hardwood deck which matches the timber used inside the café and resin bonded gravel paths with metal edges. Hornbeam hedges help to frame the new building and Mediterranean style planting provides a colourful and contemporary link to the Italian Gardens. A custom built bench on the edge of the deck allows for informal seating.

Adjacent works included a new storage and staff room behind Queen Anne’s Alcove, access improvements to the service yard, new cycle parking and enhancement of the nearby public toilets.

The café was opened on a sunny evening by The Royal Parks Chairman Loyd Grossman CBE and the park manager Andrew Williams. Visitors are now enjoying the fantastic new facility and the stunning views out over the planting to the fountains and park beyond. The income generated will help to maintain the surrounding gardens.

However, fish are no longer sold here as the fish market moved to the Isle of Dogs in 1962.  Nevertheless, the original building survived and was converted into a hospitality and events venue.  

It's interesting to contrast the architecture of the 1870s with the modern glass construction next to it – I know which one I prefer!

The Shard, also referred to as the Shard of Glass, Shard London Bridge and formerly London Bridge Tower, is a 95-storey skyscraper in Southwark, London, that forms part of the London Bridge Quarter development. Standing 309.7 metres (1,016 ft) high, the Shard is the tallest building in the United Kingdom, the fourth-tallest building in Europe and the 111th-tallest building in the world. It is also the second-tallest free-standing structure in the United Kingdom, after the concrete tower at the Emley Moor transmitting station.

The Shard's construction began in March 2009; it was topped out on 30 March 2012 and inaugurated on 6 July 2012. Practical completion was achieved in November 2012. The tower's privately operated observation deck, The View from The Shard, was opened to the public on 1 February 2013. The glass-clad pyramidal tower has 72 habitable floors, with a viewing gallery and open-air observation deck on the 72nd floor, at a height of 244.3 metres (802 ft). It was designed by the Italian architect Renzo Piano and replaced Southwark Towers, a 24-storey office block built on the site in 1975. The Shard was developed by Sellar Property Group on behalf of LBQ Ltd and is jointly owned by Sellar Property and the State of Qatar.

The Shard, auch Shard London Bridge (vormals London Bridge Tower, auch Shard of Glass; von englisch shard ‚Scherbe‘, ‚Splitter‘), ist ein Wolkenkratzer in Londons Stadtteil Southwark, der mit 310 Metern von Juli bis Oktober 2012 das höchste Gebäude Europas war und derzeit das höchste Gebäude der EU ist. Der verzögerte Baubeginn erfolgte am 16. März 2009, die Einweihung war am 1. Februar 2013. Die endgültige Bauhöhe von 310 Metern wurde am 30. März 2012 durch Aufsetzen einer stählernen Spitze als letztes Bauelement erreicht. Bauherr war der frühere Modehersteller und heutige Immobilieninvestor Irvine Sellar, an dessen Immobilienfirma Shard Funding Limited der Golfstaat Katar einen Mehrheitsanteil von 95 % erwarb. Da das Staatsvermögen von Katar gleichbedeutend mit dem Privatbesitz der herrschenden Familie Al Thani ist, gehört es zum Londoner Immobilienportfolio Familie Al Thani.

It seems that the ECML is a poisoned chalice, but one probably concocted in part by DaFT themselves by being greedy and taking the highest bid instead of the most economically and operationally sound option. Will the news ultimately result in all the fleet again being splashed with grey paint, similar to when it was last in state hands and run by Directly Operated Railways (DOR)?

She then became part of the reserve fleet, but decommissioning came in 1971; however she evaded the scrap man and is now preserved attracting some 250,000 visitors a year.  Definitely worth a visit.

She is a Flower Class anti-submarine Q-ship, but is now permanently moored on the River Thames in the heart of London.  She has been there since 1922, initially fulfilling the role of a Royal Navy Reserve drill ship until being sold in 1982.  

She now provides a venue for conferences and functions plus offices.  The somewhat bizarre livery was applied to commemorate the 'dazzle' livery used during the First World War to make shipping more difficult for enemy submarines to find and hit accurately.  

Since I took this picture on Sunday, 23rd August, 2015, HQMS PRESIDENT (1918) has been moved to Chatham.

28034492078,"133876835@N08","3",NA,"London - Chelsea","Chelsea is an affluent area of South West London, bounded to the south by the River Thames. Its frontage runs from Chelsea Bridge along the Chelsea Embankment, Cheyne Walk, Lots Road and Chelsea Harbour. Its eastern boundary was once defined by the River Westbourne, which is now in a pipe above Sloane Square Underground station. The modern eastern boundary is Chelsea Bridge Road and the lower half of Sloane Street, including Sloane Square. To the north and northwest, the area fades into Knightsbridge and Brompton, but it is considered that the area north of King's Road as far northwest as Fulham Road is part of Chelsea.

The district is entirely within the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, although Chelsea gives its name to nearby locations, such as Chelsea Harbour located within the London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham, and Chelsea Barracks in the City of Westminster. From 1900, and until the creation of Greater London in 1965, it formed the Metropolitan Borough of Chelsea in the County of London.

The exclusivity of Chelsea as a result of its high property prices has historically resulted in the term Sloane Ranger being used to describe its residents. Since 2011, Channel 4 has broadcast a reality television show called Made in Chelsea, documenting the lives of affluent young people living there. Moreover, Chelsea is home to one of the largest communities of Americans living outside the United States, with 6.53% of Chelsea residents being born in the U.S.

Chelsea ist ein Stadtteil im Westen von London. Er befindet sich zwischen dem Sloane Square und der Themse als der südlichen Grenze. Der Stadtteil gehört zum Stadtbezirk Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea. Der gleichnamige Fußballclub Chelsea FC ist jedoch im Stadtteil Fulham beheimatet.

Im Stadtteil befindet sich das Krankenhaus für pensionierte Soldaten Royal Hospital Chelsea. Es wurde von 1682 bis 1692 nach den Plänen von Christopher Wren gebaut. In der Nachbarschaft befindet sich das National Army Museum. Es wurde an der Stelle des im Jahr 1809 von John Soane gebauten und im Zweiten Weltkrieg zerstörten Anbaus des Krankenhauses errichtet.

Die Hauptstraße des Stadtteils King’s Road wurde im 17. Jahrhundert durch König Karl II. angelegt, um eine Verbindung zum Kew Palace zu schaffen. Bis zum Jahr 1830 befand sie sich im Privatbesitz der Krone.

Die King’s Road gehörte in den 1960er und den 1970er Jahren zu den Zentren der Subkultur der Hippies und der Punks. Malcolm McLaren und Vivienne Westwood eröffneten dort im Jahr 1972 den Laden SEX, in dem Mode im Punk-Stil verkauft wurde. Später zog die Szene in andere Stadtteile, vorwiegend Notting Hill und Camden Town.

Chelsea ist Sitz des Chelsea College of Art and Design. Seit 2008 hat die Saatchi Gallery ihren Sitz in Chelsea.

40784003534,"133876835@N08","3",NA,"London - Green Park","The Green Park, usually known without the article simply as Green Park, is one of the Royal Parks of London. It is located in the City of Westminster, central London.

Green Park covers 19 hectares (47 acres) between Hyde Park and St. James's Park. Together with Kensington Gardens and the gardens of Buckingham Palace, these parks form an almost unbroken stretch of open land reaching from Whitehall and Victoria station to Kensington and Notting Hill.

In contrast with its neighbouring parks, Green Park has no lakes, no buildings, no playgrounds, and few monuments, having only the Canada Memorial by Pierre Granche, the Diana Fountain, and the RAF Bomber Command Memorial. The park consists almost entirely of mature trees rising out of turf; the only flowers are naturalized narcissus.

The park is bounded on the south by Constitution Hill, on the east by the pedestrian Queen's Walk, and on the north by Piccadilly. It meets St. James's Park at Queen's Gardens with the Victoria Memorial at its centre, opposite the entrance to Buckingham Palace. To the south is the ceremonial avenue of the Mall, and the buildings of St James's Palace and Clarence House overlook the park to the east. Green Park tube station is a major interchange located on Piccadilly, Victoria and Jubilee lines near the north end of Queen's Walk. Tyburn stream runs beneath Green Park.

The park is said to have originally been swampy burial ground for lepers from the nearby hospital at St James's. It was first enclosed in 16th century when it formed part of the estate of Poulteney family. In 1668, an area of the Poulteney estate known as Sandpit Field was surrendered to Charles II, who made the bulk of the land into a Royal Park as &quot;Upper St James's Park&quot; and enclosed it with a brick wall. He laid out the park's main walks and built an icehouse there to supply him with ice for cooling drinks in summer.

The Queen's Walk was laid out for George II's queen Caroline; it led to the reservoir that held drinking water for St James's Palace, called the Queen's Basin.

At the time, the park was on the outskirts of London and remained an isolated area well into the 18th century, when it was known as a haunt of highwaymen and thieves; Horace Walpole was one of many to be robbed there. During the 18th and 19th centuries, it was a popular place for ballooning attempts and public firework displays; Handel's Music for the Royal Fireworks was composed specifically for a fireworks celebration held in The Green Park in 1749. The park was also known as a duelling ground; one particularly notorious duel took place there in 1730 between William Pulteney, 1st Earl of Bath and John Hervey, 1st Earl of Bristol.

In 1820, John Nash landscaped the park, as an adjunct to St. James's Park. On 10 June 1840, it was the scene of Edward Oxford's assassination attempt on Queen Victoria, on Constitution Hill.

Green Park (offiziell The Green Park, englisch für „Der grüne Park“) ist einer der königlichen Parks in London. Der Park liegt zwischen dem Hyde Park im Westen und dem St. James’s Park im Osten. Zusammen mit den Kensington Gardens bilden diese Parks einen über vier Kilometer langen, nur durch einige Straßen unterbrochenen Grünstreifen im Stadtzentrum Londons.

Der Green Park war ursprünglich ein sumpfiger Begräbnisplatz für Leprakranke. 1668 ließ König Charles II. hier Hirsche aussetzen, damit das Gelände als Jagdgebiet dienen konnte. Er nannte die Grünfläche Upper St. James Park, ließ ihn mit einer Backsteinmauer einfassen sowie ein Eishaus errichten, um auch im Sommer frisches Eis zur Verfügung zu haben. Die berühmte Feuerwerksmusik des Komponisten Georg Friedrich Händel wurde im Green Park uraufgeführt. Sie war anlässlich des im Oktober 1748 geschlossenen Friedens von Aachen zur Beendigung des Österreichischen Erbfolgekriegs als Begleitmusik zu einem gigantischen Feuerwerk komponiert worden. Aufgrund der feuchten Witterung zündete das Feuerwerk jedoch nicht. Zu allem Überfluss geriet dann auch noch ein Teil der Bühnenkonstruktion in Brand. Einzig durch Händels Musik wurde das Fest nicht zum Fiasko. Der Green Park lag damals am Stadtrand von London und war bis ins 18. Jahrhundert berüchtigt für Raubüberfälle und Duelle. Auch danach war er lange Zeit gefährlich - wie beim ersten Attentat auf Königin Victoria im Jahr 1840.

Im Gegensatz zu den benachbarten Parks besaß der Green Park bis 2012 keine Statuen, Springbrunnen oder Seen, sondern bestand ausschließlich aus einer mit zahlreichen Bäumen bestandenen Wiese. Seit 2012 befinden sich hier das Memorial des RAF Bomber Command, der Lady-Diana-Brunnen und der Canada Fountain sowie die Statue der Artemis am Eingang zur U-Bahn-Station Green Park. Nahe dem Buckingham Palace liegt auch das Canada Gate, das im Zuge des Victoria Memorials am Anfang des 20. Jahrhunderts errichtet wurde. Im Norden wird der Park durch die Straße Piccadilly begrenzt, im Süden durch den Constitution Hill (mit dem Buckingham Palace auf der gegenüberliegenden Seite).

An der Nordostecke des dreieckförmigen Parks befindet sich die Station Green Park der London Underground, wo Züge der Jubilee Line, der Piccadilly Line und der Victoria Line halten.

Westminster Cathedral (or the Metropolitan Cathedral of the Precious Blood of Our Lord Jesus Christ) is the mother church of the Catholic Church in England and Wales. 
In the neo-Byzantine style. Opened in 1903, the interior mosaics still aren't finished.

Chapel of St Paul
St Paul, together with St Peter, founded the Church at Rome. ...
He was a tent-maker, and the ceiling of the chapel is decorated to represent a tent. On the back wall is portrayed the story of his conversion. Travelling from Jerusalem (on the right) to Damascus (on the left), Paul is blinded by a great light, and is addressed by the Risen Christ. Beneath the scene the Latin inscription records Christ's words: &quot;Get up, and go into the city, and you will be told what to do&quot; (Acts 9:6).
On the right hand on the chapel Paul is shown shipwrecked off Malta (in Latin, MELITA). The mosaic over the arch opposite represents the riddle of Samson (Judges 14:14): bees around the head of a lion represent sweetness coming forth from strength (in Latin DE FORTI EGRESSA EST DULCEDO) - a reference to Paul's good works follows his former bitterness towards Christianity. Also depicted is a basket with ropes attached, recalling Paul's escape from Damascus when he was lowered over the wall in a basket (Acts 9:25)
Over the altar, Paul is shown with his traditional sword - a symbol both of his eloquence in preaching the Word of God, and of his death. The grey marble on the walls comes from near Athens, where Paul himself preached (Acts 17:15). Above, Christ is depicted with St Peter and St Paul, and the Latin inscription translates &quot;The Lord gives us the Law&quot;.
The floor of the chapel is in the style of the Cosmati brothers, who worked in Italy in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. It recalls the magnificent Cosmati pavement of Westminster Abbey.

Westminster Cathedral (or the Metropolitan Cathedral of the Precious Blood of Our Lord Jesus Christ) is the mother church of the Catholic Church in England and Wales. 
The site was originally marshland (Bulinga Fen), then a pleasure garden with a bull-baiting ring, a prison holding Scots during the Civil War, and Middlesex County Prison - upon whose foundations the cathedral (architect: John Francis Bentley) was built.
Opened in 1903, the interior mosaics still aren't finished.
In the neo-Byzantine style. Mistaken for a mosque by Ukip.
(Wikipedia &amp; londonist.com)

&quot;The chapel to Saint Joseph .. contains mosaics [by Christopher Hobbs] of the Holy Family (2003) and men working on Westminster Cathedral (2006). Hobbs also did the chapel in honour of Saint Thomas Becket illustrating the saint standing in front of the old Canterbury Cathedral on the chapel's east wall and the murder of Thomas on the west wall. The vault is decorated with a design of flowers, tendrils and roundels. (2006). As of 2011, there were plans for further mosaics, for example Saint Francis of Assisi and Saint Anthony in the narthex.&quot; (Wikipedia)

&quot;The fifth Archbishop of Westminster, Cardinal Hinsley, died in 1943 and is buried in this Chapel. As with most Cardinal's tombs, the distinctive red hat hangs over his place of rest and is allowed to decay as a reminder of the mortality common to all.
&quot;The decoration of the Chapel floor is of interest. In the centre of the design are four symbols of Christ the Lamb: the peacock, the fish, and the Chi-Rho sign or Monogram of Jesus Christ.&quot; (westministercathedral.org.uk)

Westminster Cathedral (or the Metropolitan Cathedral of the Precious Blood of Our Lord Jesus Christ) is the mother church of the Catholic Church in England and Wales. 
The site was originally marshland (Bulinga Fen), then a pleasure garden with a bull-baiting ring, a prison holding Scots during the Civil War, and Middlesex County Prison - upon whose foundations the cathedral (architect: John Francis Bentley) was built.
Opened in 1903, the interior mosaics still aren't finished.
In the neo-Byzantine style. Mistaken for a mosque by Ukip.
(Wikipedia &amp; londonist.com)

&quot;The chapel of the Blessed Sacrament, on the north side of the sanctuary, and the Lady Chapel on the south, are entered from the transepts; they are 6.7 m (22 ft) wide, lofty, with open arcades, barrel vaulting, and apsidal ends. Over the altar of the Blessed Sacrament chapel a small baldacchino is suspended from the vault, and the chapel is enclosed with bronze grilles and gates through which people may enter. ...
&quot;From 1960 to 1962 the Blessed Sacrament Chapel was decorated in a traditional, early Christian, style with the mosaics being predominantly pale pink in order to afford a sense of light and space. The designer, Boris Anrep, chose various Eucharistic themes such as the sacrifice of Abel, the hospitality of Abraham and the gathering of the manna in the wilderness as well as the Feeding the multitude and the Wedding Feast at Cana.&quot; (Wikipedia)

Westminster Cathedral (or the Metropolitan Cathedral of the Precious Blood of Our Lord Jesus Christ) is the mother church of the Catholic Church in England and Wales. 
In the neo-Byzantine style. Opened in 1903. The interior mosaics unfinished (as you can see in this photo!)

The Lady Chapel
The rich decoration of the chapel gives a glimpse of what the completed Cathedral will be. Here, on the Feast of St Joseph in 1903, the first Mass was said in Westminster Cathedral.
Above the altar is an image of the Virgin and the child Jesus. In the centre is the Tree of Life (the Cross) symbolising not death but eternal life. From it gush fountains of living water, and its branches produce vines, the refuge for birds and other living creatures.
To the left of the Tree stands Mary, portrayed as Patroness of London, in front of the Tower of London and Tower Bridge. Next to her is Gabriel, archangel of the Annunciation, and a group of saints renowned for their devotion to the Virgin Mary. To the right of the Tree is St Peter, Patron of Westminster, in front of Westminster Cathedral. Beside him is the archangel Michael, and a medallion of King David.
The domed vault is marked with a wreath, containing portraits of the first four Cardinals of Westminster. Above these scenes, angels hold a garland, representing the Rosary. The tops of the window recesses bear portraits of early women martyrs: St Lucy, St Agatha, St Justine, St Cecilia and St Catherine.  In the four alcoves set into the marble are represented four prophets who foretold the coming of the Messiah: Daniel, Ezekiel, Jeremiah, Isaiah.
The arch at the entrance to the chapel has a Latin inscription recalling the Immaculate Conception of Our Lady: Tota pulchra es, Maria, et macula originalis non est in te (Thou art all fair, O Mary, and the original stain of sin is not in thee).

Westminster Cathedral (or the Metropolitan Cathedral of the Precious Blood of Our Lord Jesus Christ) is the mother church of the Catholic Church in England and Wales. 
In the neo-Byzantine style. Opened in 1903, the interior mosaics still aren't finished.

Holy Souls Chapel
  This Chapel ... is the only one which was completely designed by [the cathedral's architect] John Francis Bentley himself. ... The mosaic decoration was executed by Christian Symons.

  Images in this Chapel show the 'old' Adam by the forbidden tree, and the 'new' Adam - the risen Christ. On the west wall is an image of Purgatory: Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego in the burning fiery furnace, protected by the Son of Man ...

Lying just off the main roundabout of Junction 1 of the M40, down a very easily missed little lane with a sign saying 'village only',  Denham is an unexpected delight.

In the late 1930s and early 1940s, it was the home of actress Merle Oberon and her husband, the film producer Sir Alexander Korda. In 1975 the house was purchased by the actors Sir John and Lady Mills.

Denham Studios (aka London Studios) were founded by Alexander Korda in 1935, on a 165-acre (668,000 m²) site known as 'The Fisheries', north of Denham Green. At the time it was the largest facility of its kind in the UK. Some of the notable films made at Denham include, The Thief of Bagdad, 49th Parallel, Brief Encounter, Great Expectations and Hamlet. 
The film studios closed in the 50's and were absorbed by Pinewood Studios a mere 4 miles to the south. However, Denham became one of the most important centres for recording film music, and by 1969 the studio claimed it was the most technologically advanced recording studio in Europe. Among some of the important films recorded there was Vertigo, Star Wars, Alien and the Empire Strikes Back. This facility also closed in the 1980's and is now a luxury apartment complex.","denham, buckinghamshire, england, village, cottage, street, chiltern",0,51.572602,-0.497721,NA,NA,"2019-04-30 11:44:15"

I was originally enrolled into the GETTY IMAGES collection as a contributor on April 9th 2012, and when links with FLICKR were terminated in March 2014, I was retained and fortunate enough to be signed up via a second contract, both of which have proved to be successful with sales of my photographs all over the world now handled exclusively by them. 

 


On November 12th 2015 GETTY IMAGES unveiled plans for a new stills upload platform called ESP (Enterprise Submission Platform), to replace the existing 'Moment portal', and on November 13th I was invited to Beta test the new system prior to it being officially rolled out in December. ESP went live on Tuesday December 15th 2015 and has smoothed out the upload process considerably.


These days I take a far more leisurely approach to my photographic exploits, a Nikon D850 FX Pro body as companion to my D7200 DX, I travel light with less constraints and more emphasis on the pure capture of the beauty that I see, more akin to my original persuits and goals some five decades previously when starting out. I would like to say a huge and heartfelt 'THANK YOU' to GETTY IMAGES, and the 28.719+ Million visitors to my FLICKR site.

Part of SOAS Concert Series (free event).

Country: Italy (British resident). Style: Tarantella &amp; Pizzica.

Lineup: Simona De Leonardis (v/tamburello/castanets/dance), Massimiliano Passante (v/tamburello), Alfredo Giani (v/mandola/g/dance), Cassandre Balasso-Bardin (recorder/gaita/willow flute), Antonio Fersini (g), Thodoris Ziarkas (b) with Mark Glanville (v/tamburello/bottle/dance).

I took photos of this band six years ago (<a href=""""http://www.flickr.com/photos/kmlivemusic/albums/72157634133665155/"""">www.flickr.com/photos/kmlivemusic/albums/72157634133665155/</a>). Now as then several band members were missing - this time including Carla Pandarese (v/dancer). Like then the group were joined by Mark Glanville whose bass baritone vocals were featured on songs in Griko. I have also phographed Cassandre Balasso-Bardin with Olcay Bayir (<a href=""""https://www.flickr.com/photos/kmlivemusic/tags/cassandrebalassobardin,-amaraterra/"""">www.flickr.com/photos/kmlivemusic/tags/cassandrebalassoba...</a>) and Thodoris Ziarkas with both Kalia and Yiannis Chaldoupis (<a href=""""https://www.flickr.com/photos/kmlivemusic/tags/theodorisziarkas,-amaraterra/"""">www.flickr.com/photos/kmlivemusic/tags/theodorisziarkas,-...</a>).

.


I was originally enrolled into the GETTY IMAGES collection as a contributor on April 9th 2012, and when links with FLICKR were terminated in March 2014, I was retained and fortunate enough to be signed up via a second contract, both of which have proved to be successful with sales of my photographs all over the world now handled exclusively by them. 

 


On November 12th 2015 GETTY IMAGES unveiled plans for a new stills upload platform called ESP (Enterprise Submission Platform), to replace the existing 'Moment portal', and on November 13th I was invited to Beta test the new system prior to it being officially rolled out in December. ESP went live on Tuesday December 15th 2015 and has smoothed out the upload process considerably.


These days I take a far more leisurely approach to my photographic exploits, a Nikon D850 FX Pro body as my trusted companion, I travel light with less constraints and more emphasis on the pure capture of the beauty that I see, more akin to my original persuits and goals some five decades previously when starting out. I would like to say a huge and heartfelt 'THANK YOU' to GETTY IMAGES, and the 31.876+ Million visitors to my FLICKR site.

I was originally enrolled into the GETTY IMAGES collection as a contributor on April 9th 2012, and when links with FLICKR were terminated in March 2014, I was retained and fortunate enough to be signed up via a second contract, both of which have proved to be successful with sales of my photographs all over the world now handled exclusively by them. 

 


On November 12th 2015 GETTY IMAGES unveiled plans for a new stills upload platform called ESP (Enterprise Submission Platform), to replace the existing 'Moment portal', and on November 13th I was invited to Beta test the new system prior to it being officially rolled out in December. ESP went live on Tuesday December 15th 2015 and has smoothed out the upload process considerably.


These days I take a far more leisurely approach to my photographic exploits, a Nikon D850 FX Pro body as my trusted companion, I travel light with less constraints and more emphasis on the pure capture of the beauty that I see, more akin to my original persuits and goals some five decades previously when starting out. I would like to say a huge and heartfelt 'THANK YOU' to GETTY IMAGES, and the 31.818+ Million visitors to my FLICKR site.

Rosengarten

Hampton Court Palace is a royal palace in the borough of Richmond upon Thames, 11.7 miles (18.8 kilometres) south west and upstream of central London on the River Thames. Building of the palace began in 1515 for Cardinal Thomas Wolsey, a favourite of King Henry VIII. In 1529, as Wolsey fell from favour, the cardinal gave the palace to the King to check his disgrace; Henry VIII later enlarged it. Along with St James's Palace, it is one of only two surviving palaces out of the many owned by King Henry VIII. 

In the following century, King William III's massive rebuilding and expansion work, which was intended to rival Versailles, destroyed much of the Tudor palace. Work ceased in 1694, leaving the palace in two distinct contrasting architectural styles, domestic Tudor and Baroque. While the palace's styles are an accident of fate, a unity exists due to the use of pink bricks and a symmetrical, if vague, balancing of successive low wings. King George II was the last monarch to reside in the palace. 

Today, the palace is open to the public and is a major tourist attraction, easily reached by train from Waterloo station in central London and served by Hampton Court railway station in East Molesey, in Transport for London's Zone 6. In addition, London Buses routes 111, 216, 411 and R68 stop outside the palace gates. The structure and grounds are cared for by an independent charity, Historic Royal Palaces, which receives no funding from the Government or the Crown. In addition the palace continues to display a large number of works of art from the Royal Collection. 

Apart from the Palace itself and its gardens, other points of interest for visitors include the celebrated maze, the historic real tennis court, and the huge grape vine, the largest in the world as of 2005. 

The palace's Home Park is the site of the annual Hampton Court Palace Festival and Hampton Court Palace Flower Show.

The grounds as they appear today were laid out in grand style in the late 17th century. There are no authentic remains of Henry VIII's gardens, merely a small knot garden, planted in 1924, which hints at the gardens' 16th-century appearance. Today, the dominating feature of the grounds is the great landscaping scheme constructed for Sir Christopher Wren's intended new palace. From a water-bounded semicircular parterre, the length of the east front, three avenues radiate in a crow's foot pattern. The central avenue, containing not a walk or a drive, but the great canal known as the Long Water, was excavated during the reign of Charles II, in 1662. The design, radical at the time, is another immediately recognizable influence from Versailles, and was indeed laid out by pupils of André Le Nôtre, Louis XIV's landscape gardener.

On the south side of the palace is the Privy Garden bounded by semi-circular wrought iron gates by Jean Tijou. This garden, originally William III's private garden, was replanted in 1992 in period style with manicured hollies and yews along a geometric system of paths.

On a raised site overlooking the Thames, is a small pavilion, the Banqueting House. This was built circa 1700, for informal meals and entertainments in the gardens rather than for the larger state dinners which would have taken place inside the palace itself. A nearby conservatory houses the &quot;Great Vine&quot;, planted in 1769; by 1968 it had a trunk 81 inches thick and has a length of 100 feet. It still produces an annual crop of grapes.

The palace included apartments for the use of favoured royal friends. One such apartment is described as being in &quot;The Pavilion and situated on the Home Park&quot; of Hampton Court Palace. This privilege was first extended about 1817 by Prince Edward, Duke of Kent and Strathearn, to his friend, Lieut General James Moore, K.C., and his new bride, Miss Cecilia Watson. George IV continued this arrangement following the death of Prince Edward on 23 January 1820. The Queen continued the arrangement for the widow of General Moore, following his death on 24 April 1838. This particular apartment was used for 21 years or more and spanned three different sponsors.

A well-known curiosity of the palace's grounds is Hampton Court Maze; planted in the 1690s by George London and Henry Wise for William III. It was originally planted with hornbeam; it has been repaired latterly using many different types of hedge. there is a 3D online browser simulation of the Hampton Court Maze.

Inspired by narrow views of a Tudor garden that can be seen through doorways in a painting, The Family of Henry VIII, hanging in the palace's Haunted Gallery, a new garden in the style of Henry VIII's 16th-century Privy Gardens, has been designed to celebrate the anniversary of that King's accession to the throne. Sited on the former Chapel Court Garden, it has been planted with flowers and herbs from the 16th century, and is completed by gilded heraldic beasts and bold green and white painted fences. The heraldic beasts carved by Ben Harms and Ray Gonzalez of G&amp;H Studios include the golden lion of England, The white greyhound of Richmond, the red dragon of Wales and the white hart of Richard II, all carved from English oak. The garden's architect was Todd Langstaffe-Gowan, who collaborated with James Fox and the Gardens Team at Historic Royal Palaces.

The formal gardens and park are Grade I listed on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens.

Hampton Court Palace ist ein Schloss im äußersten Südwesten Londons am linken Ufer der Themse im Stadtbezirk Richmond upon Thames. Das Schloss war von 1528 bis 1737 eine bevorzugte Residenz der englischen und britischen Könige. Ursprünglich wurde es im Tudorstil erbaut, gegen Ende des 17. Jahrhunderts und im 18. Jahrhundert wurden große Teile im Stile des englischen Barock umgebaut. Mit seinen gewaltigen Ausmaßen, seiner prächtigen Innenausstattung und seinen ausgedehnten Gärten gilt es als eines der Hauptwerke des Tudorstils und des Barocks in England. 

Das Schloss erlebte mehrere königliche Hochzeiten, Geburten und Sterbefälle. Heinrich VIII. heiratete hier seine sechste Gemahlin Catherine Parr. Sein Sohn Eduard VI. wurde im Schloss geboren und getauft, dessen Mutter Jane Seymour sowie die Frau Jakobs I., Anna starben in dem Schloss, und Wilhelm III. erlitt im Park einen Reitunfall, an dessen Folgen er wenig später starb.

Hampton Court besaß einst einen der prachtvollsten Gärten in ganz Europa. Vermutlich befand sich an der Stelle des heutigen Brunnenhofs bereits ein Garten für Kardinal Wolsey. Heinrich VIII. ließ vor der Südfassade einen Garten anlegen. Andre Mollet legte für Karl II. ab 1661 den großen Kanal an, der mittelachsig vom Schloss ausging und mit den sternförmig vom Schlossplatz ausgehenden Alleen korrespondierte. Parallel zum barocken Ausbau des Schlosses durch Christopher Wren erfolgte die Anlage der Gärten nach französischem Vorbild. 

Heute ist das Schloss von einem 24 ha großen Garten umgeben, der in drei Anlagen unterteilt wird: 

Der südlich des Schlosses gelegene Privy Garden, der königliche Privatgarten, wurde 1995 als formal angelegter Barockgarten im Zustand von 1702 restauriert. Er besteht aus vier um einen runden Teich angelegte Broderieparterres und wurde ursprünglich 1689 von Henry Wise angelegt. An der Südspitze verläuft am gewundenen Ufer der Themse entlang ein reich gearbeiteter, schmiedeeiserner Zaun von Jean Tijou. Westlich des Privy Garten liegt ein 1924 im Stil der Tudorzeit angelegter Knotengarten sowie der aus Blumenbeeten bestehende Teichgarten. Die untere Orangerie dient heute als Ausstellungsraum für Mantegnas Der Triumph des Caesar. Neben der Orangiere befindet sich in einem Gewächshaus der 1769 von Lancelot Capability Brown gepflanzte The great Vine. Der Weinstock gilt mit einem Umfang von 3,8 m und mit bis zu 75 m langen Zweigen als größter Weinstock der Welt. Am Themseufer befindet sich das Banqueting House, ein 1700 gebauter und innen von Antonio Verrio ausgemalter intimer Speisesaal.

Den östlichen Garten ließ Wilhelm III. von Daniel Marot als halbkreisförmigen Brunnengarten mit zwölf Springbrunnen, Buchsbaumrabatten und Statuen anlegen. Die Brunnen, Beete und Statuen wurden bereits ab 1707 unter Königin Anne wieder entfernt, ab 1710 wurde der Garten von halbrunden Kanälen eingefasst. Seine heutige Form mit Rasenflächen und gestutzten Eiben und Stechpalmen erhielt der Garten schließlich im 19. Jahrhundert. Am nördlichen Ende des entlang der Schlossfassade führenden Breiten Wegs liegt der um 1620 angelegte Tennisplatz, der auch heute noch als Sportstätte dient.

Nördlich des Schlosses lag in der Tudor-Zeit der große Obstgarten sowie der Turnierplatz, der über fünf Türme für die Zuschauer verfügte. Wilhelm III. ließ ab 1690 von Henry Wise den nördlichen Garten als Wilderness mit hohen gestutzten Hecken anlegen. Der berühmte, trapezförmige Irrgarten ist der einzig erhaltene Rest dieser Gartenanlage. Durch den etwa 1350 m² großen Irrgarten führen etwa 800 m gewundene Wege durch zwei Meter hohe Eibenhecken. Der übrige Garten ist heute eine mit Bäumen bestandene Wiese. Der frühere Turnierplatz ist heute in kleinere Gärten unterteilt, einer der Zuschauertürme ist noch erhalten und befindet sich neben dem Gartenrestaurant.

Östlich der Gärten erstreckt sich in einer Themseschleife der 304 ha große Home Park. Bereits Giles Daubeney ließ einen etwa 120 ha großen Hirschpark einrichten. Im Park lebt heute eine etwa 270 Tiere starke Damwildherde, durch den Park führen mehrere Alleen und der etwa 1 km lange große Kanal. Nördlich des Wildparks schließt sich der Bushy Park an. 

Anfang Juli findet im Park seit 1990 jährlich die von der Royal Horticultural Society veranstaltete einwöchige Hampton Court Palace Flower Show statt, die größte jährliche Blumenschau der Welt.

&quot;The Queen Elizabeth II Great Court is a covered square at the centre of the British Museum designed by the engineers Buro Happold and the architects Foster and Partners. The Great Court opened in December 2000 and is the largest covered square in Europe. The roof is a glass and steel construction, built by an Austrian steelwork company, with 1,656 uniquely shaped panes of glass. At the centre of the Great Court is the Reading Room vacated by the British Library, its functions now moved to St Pancras. The Reading Room is open to any member of the public who wishes to read there.&quot;

At Heathrow we had breakfast and saw a couple of the members of the “boy” band Blue travelling on our flight from London - going incognito.  

The flight with LH from T2 was late leaving and the German crew seemed quite upset with the situation and mainly blamed the Brits for not being able to run and airport.  Got to Frankfurt and we were on remote.  And the outbound flight was delayed due to traffic on the taxiiways. Queuing up to board, we had calls from John our builder prepping for our new conservatory who had discovered some block drains under our old patio.  The crew changed our flights to sort of exit row seats, which was good. We Sarah and I managed to get an exit row seats together.  The flight was OK but the family behind us was happy for their kids to kick our seats (until Sarah spoke to them in German),  

We passed through immigration alright and travelled with another couple James and Jane to the hotel in Delhi. We got there at 5am and went straight to sleep. ","",0,51.469963,-0.448831,NA,"UK","2019-04-11 08:50:09"

On Bouge, <a href=""""https://onbouge.org/"""" rel=""""noreferrer nofollow"""">onbouge.org/</a>.

Country: France &amp; Belgium. Style: Traditional French - Centre France.

Lineup: Gilles Chabenat (hurdy gurdy), Fred Pouget (bass clarinet/clarinet), Maarten Decombel (g).

Tondo is a new collaboration between Gilles Chabenat and Fred Pouget from Lignières (Centre-Val de Loire ) and Brive (Limousin) in France (who also perform together in the Clax Quartet) and Maarten Decombel from Flanders. These are my first photos of Chabenat  though I have seen him four times before (all apart from the first at the Grand Bal de Bath) - with I Muvrani in  2002, solo and as a guest of other bands in  2006, with Claeys - Paris - Chabenat - Geerinck in 2008 and with Trio Chabenat, Montbel, Charrier in 2009. I do have photos of Decombel with Griff in 2007 (<a href=""""http://www.flickr.com/photos/kmlivemusic/albums/72157626254826974/"""">www.flickr.com/photos/kmlivemusic/albums/72157626254826974/</a>) and with Göze in 2010 (<a href=""""http://www.flickr.com/photos/kmlivemusic/albums/72157625416299934/"""">www.flickr.com/photos/kmlivemusic/albums/72157625416299934/</a>).

From Wikipedia : &quot;122 Leadenhall Street, also known as the Leadenhall Building, is a skyscraper in London that is 225 metres (738 ft) tall. It opened in July 2014 and was designed by Rogers Stirk Harbour + Partners; it is known informally as The Cheesegrater because of its distinctive wedge shape similar to that of the kitchen utensil with the same name. It is one of a number of tall buildings recently completed or under construction in the City of London financial district, including 20 Fenchurch Street, The Pinnacle, and The Scalpel.

The site is adjacent to the Lloyd's Building, also designed by Rogers, which is the current home of the insurance market Lloyd's of London. Until 2007 the Leadenhall site was occupied by a building owned by British Land and designed by Gollins Melvin Ward Partnership, which was constructed in the 1960s. That building was demolished in preparation for redevelopment of the site. By December 2009, the site was cleared but construction had stalled. The project, initially delayed due to the financial crisis, was revived in October 2010 and Oxford Properties has co-developed the property in partnership with British Land.&quot;

From Wikipedia : &quot;122 Leadenhall Street, also known as the Leadenhall Building, is a skyscraper in London that is 225 metres (738 ft) tall. It opened in July 2014 and was designed by Rogers Stirk Harbour + Partners; it is known informally as The Cheesegrater because of its distinctive wedge shape similar to that of the kitchen utensil with the same name. It is one of a number of tall buildings recently completed or under construction in the City of London financial district, including 20 Fenchurch Street, The Pinnacle, and The Scalpel.

The site is adjacent to the Lloyd's Building, also designed by Rogers, which is the current home of the insurance market Lloyd's of London. Until 2007 the Leadenhall site was occupied by a building owned by British Land and designed by Gollins Melvin Ward Partnership, which was constructed in the 1960s. That building was demolished in preparation for redevelopment of the site. By December 2009, the site was cleared but construction had stalled. The project, initially delayed due to the financial crisis, was revived in October 2010 and Oxford Properties has co-developed the property in partnership with British Land.&quot;

Having seen some interior shots of the buildings I do wonder what it will be like working in one of the top five floors of the building given they've covered in brightly coloured glass......

From the Londonist website : &quot;Designed by Eric Parry Architects on behalf of insurance company Generali, One Fen Court is a noteworthy building even if you ignore the roof garden. That's largely thanks to its unusual design — it's almost one building stacked on top of another. The higher level is covered in iridescent strips, producing a vivid colourful effect both inside and outside.&quot;

From Wikipedia

The British Rail Class 800 is a type of bi-mode multiple unit used in the United Kingdom on the Great Western Main Line since October 2017. They use electric motors for traction, but in addition to operating on track with overhead electric wires, they have diesel generators to enable them to operate on unelectrified track. Based on the Hitachi A-train design, the trains have been built Hitachi since 2014. They are also very similar to the Class 802 units, which have uprated diesel engines and larger fuel tanks.

The units are also due to enter service on the East Coast Main Line from May 2019, under the brand name &quot;Azuma. This date was originally earlier, but following delays in type testing and concerns over the safety of interconnecting electrical cables between the coaches, the date had to be changed.

These trains are being assembled at the Hitachi Newton Aycliffe facility, alongside the related Class 801 electric multiple unit, from bodyshells shipped from the Kasado plant in Japan; no body construction takes place in the UK.

The Class 800 units are part of the Intercity Express Programme (IEP). The train is part of the Hitachi AT300 product family. Train operating companies have also given the train separate brands. On Great Western Railway, they are known as Intercity Express Trains (IET) and when they enter service with London North Eastern Railway, they will be known as Azumas.","networkrail, britishrail, greatwesternrailway, gwr, railway, station, railwaystation, train, powercar, multipleunit, people, platform, rail, track, paddingtonstation, cityofwestminster, london, westlondon, england, uk, greatbritain, roof",0,51.516588,-0.177079,"London","England","2019-02-16 09:36:30"

From Wikipedia : &quot;122 Leadenhall Street, also known as the Leadenhall Building, is a skyscraper in London that is 225 metres (738 ft) tall. It opened in July 2014 and was designed by Rogers Stirk Harbour + Partners; it is known informally as The Cheesegrater because of its distinctive wedge shape similar to that of the kitchen utensil with the same name. It is one of a number of tall buildings recently completed or under construction in the City of London financial district, including 20 Fenchurch Street, The Pinnacle, and The Scalpel.

The site is adjacent to the Lloyd's Building, also designed by Rogers, which is the current home of the insurance market Lloyd's of London. Until 2007 the Leadenhall site was occupied by a building owned by British Land and designed by Gollins Melvin Ward Partnership, which was constructed in the 1960s. That building was demolished in preparation for redevelopment of the site. By December 2009, the site was cleared but construction had stalled. The project, initially delayed due to the financial crisis, was revived in October 2010 and Oxford Properties has co-developed the property in partnership with British Land.&quot;

From the Londonist website : &quot;You don't have to scrape the sky to get stunning vistas of London. At least that's the thinking behind The Garden at 120, a new mid-level roof garden on Fenchurch Street. This suspended pocket park lives 15 floors high, atop One Fen Court......

The roof garden offers 360 degree views, but as it's only 15 floors high, some pesky neighbouring skyscrapers are unfortunately in the way. This is especially bothersome to the north, where a combination of The Scalpel, The Gherkin, The Cheesegrater and other towers in that cluster obscure the view. Still, you do get a pretty unique view of those towers, even if you can't see the greens of Hampstead Heath and Alexandra Palace beyond, like you can from the nearby Heron Tower.&quot;

Here is Tower Bridge and the Tower of London as seen from the recently opened roof garden at One Fen Court, 120 Fenchurch Street.

Click here for more shots of skyscrapers : <a href=""""https://www.flickr.com/photos/darrellg/albums/72157631363330444"""">www.flickr.com/photos/darrellg/albums/72157631363330444</a>

From the Londonist website : &quot;You don't have to scrape the sky to get stunning vistas of London. At least that's the thinking behind The Garden at 120, a new mid-level roof garden on Fenchurch Street. This suspended pocket park lives 15 floors high, atop One Fen Court......

The roof garden offers 360 degree views, but as it's only 15 floors high, some pesky neighbouring skyscrapers are unfortunately in the way. This is especially bothersome to the north, where a combination of The Scalpel, The Gherkin, The Cheesegrater and other towers in that cluster obscure the view. Still, you do get a pretty unique view of those towers, even if you can't see the greens of Hampstead Heath and Alexandra Palace beyond, like you can from the nearby Heron Tower.&quot;

Occurs in woodland, gardens, and hedgerows. Butterflies often perch in sunny spots, spiraling into the air to chase each other.

The aptly named Speckled Wood flies in partially shaded woodland with dappled sunlight. The male usually perches in a small pool of sunlight, from where it rises rapidly to intercept any intruder. Both sexes feed on honeydew in the treetops and are rarely seen feeding on flowers, except early and late in the year when aphid activity is low.

The range of this butterfly contracted during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries but has spread back since the 1920s. It has continued to spread over the past two decades, recolonizing many areas in eastern and northern England and Scotland.

I think this mid-level viewpoint gives a real impression of the canyon like streets below since this latest batch of skyscrapers has been construction..

This rooftop terrace opened back in February and I suspect most people still don't know about it.  It's not as high as most in the city but that in some ways makes it different, it's also free and doesn't require booking in advance.......

Click here for more shots of skyscrapers : <a href=""""https://www.flickr.com/photos/darrellg/albums/72157631363330444"""">www.flickr.com/photos/darrellg/albums/72157631363330444</a>

From the Londonist website : &quot;You don't have to scrape the sky to get stunning vistas of London. At least that's the thinking behind The Garden at 120, a new mid-level roof garden on Fenchurch Street. This suspended pocket park lives 15 floors high, atop One Fen Court......

The roof garden offers 360 degree views, but as it's only 15 floors high, some pesky neighbouring skyscrapers are unfortunately in the way. This is especially bothersome to the north, where a combination of The Scalpel, The Gherkin, The Cheesegrater and other towers in that cluster obscure the view. Still, you do get a pretty unique view of those towers, even if you can't see the greens of Hampstead Heath and Alexandra Palace beyond, like you can from the nearby Heron Tower.&quot;

Tutto intorno un misto di architetture, diverse per stile ed epoche.
E' una città in grande evoluzione Londra, con lo skyline che nei prossimi anni è destinato a cambiare ulteriormente.
Ovunque grattacieli in costruzione ed un grande dinamismo nelle persone.
Un'immagine molto diversa da quella, menzoniera, descrittaci dai media in Italia.
Del panico per la Brexit nemmeno l'ombra. 
La fiducia e l'orgoglio nazionale è palpabile.
A quando l'Italexit?

.


I was originally enrolled into the GETTY IMAGES collection as a contributor on April 9th 2012, and when links with FLICKR were terminated in March 2014, I was retained and fortunate enough to be signed up via a second contract, both of which have proved to be successful with sales of my photographs all over the world now handled exclusively by them. 

 


On November 12th 2015 GETTY IMAGES unveiled plans for a new stills upload platform called ESP (Enterprise Submission Platform), to replace the existing 'Moment portal', and on November 13th I was invited to Beta test the new system prior to it being officially rolled out in December. ESP went live on Tuesday December 15th 2015 and has smoothed out the upload process considerably.


These days I take a far more leisurely approach to my photographic exploits, a Nikon D850 FX Pro body as my trusted companion, I travel light with less constraints and more emphasis on the pure capture of the beauty that I see, more akin to my original persuits and goals some five decades previously when starting out. I would like to say a huge and heartfelt 'THANK YOU' to GETTY IMAGES, and the 31.612+ Million visitors to my FLICKR site.

This rooftop terrace opened back in February and I suspect most people still don't know about it.  It's not as high as most in the city but that in some ways makes it different, it's also free and doesn't require booking in advance.......

Click here for more shots of skyscrapers : <a href=""""https://www.flickr.com/photos/darrellg/albums/72157631363330444"""">www.flickr.com/photos/darrellg/albums/72157631363330444</a>

From the Londonist website : &quot;You don't have to scrape the sky to get stunning vistas of London. At least that's the thinking behind The Garden at 120, a new mid-level roof garden on Fenchurch Street. This suspended pocket park lives 15 floors high, atop One Fen Court......

The roof garden offers 360 degree views, but as it's only 15 floors high, some pesky neighbouring skyscrapers are unfortunately in the way. This is especially bothersome to the north, where a combination of The Scalpel, The Gherkin, The Cheesegrater and other towers in that cluster obscure the view. Still, you do get a pretty unique view of those towers, even if you can't see the greens of Hampstead Heath and Alexandra Palace beyond, like you can from the nearby Heron Tower.&quot;

This rooftop terrace opened back in February and I suspect most people still don't know about it.  It's not as high as most in the city but that in some ways makes it different, it's also free and doesn't require booking in advance.......

From the Londonist website : &quot;You don't have to scrape the sky to get stunning vistas of London. At least that's the thinking behind The Garden at 120, a new mid-level roof garden on Fenchurch Street. This suspended pocket park lives 15 floors high, atop One Fen Court......

The roof garden offers 360 degree views, but as it's only 15 floors high, some pesky neighbouring skyscrapers are unfortunately in the way. This is especially bothersome to the north, where a combination of The Scalpel, The Gherkin, The Cheesegrater and other towers in that cluster obscure the view. Still, you do get a pretty unique view of those towers, even if you can't see the greens of Hampstead Heath and Alexandra Palace beyond, like you can from the nearby Heron Tower.&quot;

From a Kings Cross Press Release : &quot;A new tunnel, with integrated light wall, opened yesterday at King’s Cross. The 90m long tunnel, which has a LED integrated light-wall running its entire length, was designed by Speirs + Major and delivered by The Light Lab. The tunnel itself has been designed by architects Allies &amp; Morrison and links St Pancras International and King’s Cross St Pancras Underground stations to the new public spaces, restaurants, offices and homes at King’s Cross.

Commuters were treated to something a little different on Monday morning, as the tunnel was open to the public, with commuters able to enjoy the debut light installation called Pipette. The dedicated art work on display was created by Miriam Sleeman (The Cross Kings) and Tom Sloan (Tom Sloan Design) and is designed to evoke the colourful tapestry of King’s Cross through a tranquil yet animated design.&quot;

From a Kings Cross Press Release : &quot;A new tunnel, with integrated light wall, opened yesterday at King’s Cross. The 90m long tunnel, which has a LED integrated light-wall running its entire length, was designed by Speirs + Major and delivered by The Light Lab. The tunnel itself has been designed by architects Allies &amp; Morrison and links St Pancras International and King’s Cross St Pancras Underground stations to the new public spaces, restaurants, offices and homes at King’s Cross.

Commuters were treated to something a little different on Monday morning, as the tunnel was open to the public, with commuters able to enjoy the debut light installation called Pipette. The dedicated art work on display was created by Miriam Sleeman (The Cross Kings) and Tom Sloan (Tom Sloan Design) and is designed to evoke the colourful tapestry of King’s Cross through a tranquil yet animated design.&quot;

From a Kings Cross Press Release : &quot;A new tunnel, with integrated light wall, opened yesterday at King’s Cross. The 90m long tunnel, which has a LED integrated light-wall running its entire length, was designed by Speirs + Major and delivered by The Light Lab. The tunnel itself has been designed by architects Allies &amp; Morrison and links St Pancras International and King’s Cross St Pancras Underground stations to the new public spaces, restaurants, offices and homes at King’s Cross.

Commuters were treated to something a little different on Monday morning, as the tunnel was open to the public, with commuters able to enjoy the debut light installation called Pipette. The dedicated art work on display was created by Miriam Sleeman (The Cross Kings) and Tom Sloan (Tom Sloan Design) and is designed to evoke the colourful tapestry of King’s Cross through a tranquil yet animated design.&quot;

46891077285,"79986881@N00","1","Architectural Design + Photography","UK - London - Gasholders Selfie_sq_DSC5501","When visiting the Heatherwick Studios Coal Drops Yard recently I also photographed the adjacent Gasholders development by WilkinsonEyre.  I thought the scheme showed how the previous industrial landscape can be redeveloped in a sympathetic way whilst still retaining a lot of the character.

If you are wondering what this is...... The fourth of the Gasholders has been turned into a mini park complete with a highly reflective covered walkway that runs around the perimeter.  This selfie was taken looking straight up at the underside of the walkway.

A quote from the Gasholders website : &quot;The circular aspect of the gasholders inspired the practice to arrange the apartments around three atria, flooded with light from skylights above. ‘We wanted every aspect to be unexpected, so even if you’re in the roof garden, looking down inside, you’ll see something interesting,’ says Jeff Lee, Associate at WilkinsonEyre. ‘The pool of water in the central courtyard between the three gasholder frames is designed to reflect the point where the structures meet.’&quot;

I was originally enrolled into the GETTY IMAGES collection as a contributor on April 9th 2012, and when links with FLICKR were terminated in March 2014, I was retained and fortunate enough to be signed up via a second contract, both of which have proved to be successful with sales of my photographs all over the world now handled exclusively by them. 

 


On November 12th 2015 GETTY IMAGES unveiled plans for a new stills upload platform called ESP (Enterprise Submission Platform), to replace the existing 'Moment portal', and on November 13th I was invited to Beta test the new system prior to it being officially rolled out in December. ESP went live on Tuesday December 15th 2015 and has smoothed out the upload process considerably.


These days I take a far more leisurely approach to my photographic exploits, a Nikon D850 FX Pro body as companion to my D7200 DX, I travel light with less constraints and more emphasis on the pure capture of the beauty that I see, more akin to my original persuits and goals some five decades previously when starting out. I would like to say a huge and heartfelt 'THANK YOU' to GETTY IMAGES, and the 31.313+ Million visitors to my FLICKR site.

From Wikipedia : &quot;9 Conduit is a Grade II listed townhouse in Mayfair, designed by Scottish Architect James Wyatt in 1779 as the private residence of James Viner. Following that the building hosted a bizarre variety of societies and institutions that, according to some accounts, included cyclists, balloonists and psychologists, as well as the Suffragette movement in the early 20th century, RIBA and Christian Dior.

In 1887–1909 Conduit Street was converted into the headquarters of Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) and still retains its plaque and crest in the entrance hall. During this time RIBA/AA hosted a competition to re-design the 18th century façade design and although this was never realized, the RIBA archive at the V&amp;A retains some of the competition proposal drawings.

The townhouse continued its interesting design legacy and history in the mid-20th century to become Christian Dior’s London atelier, within which Dior housed his collections. During this time in the 1970s the listed interior was modified by the seminal mid century architect and leading Pop interior designer and furniture maker Max Clendinning (b. 1924) who designed cupboards, cubicles and display cases for Dior’s ready to wear clothes and accessories. To combine the old and new, everything (including the walls, ceilings and woodwork) was painted a uniform mid-grey with a grey velvet Wilton carpet and grey uniformed attendants to “throw the clothes into sharper relief, and seems to conform with the classical, refined elegance of the House of Dior itself.” This austere style of monochromatic design was developed from his seminal 1960s signature white on white designs that marked the peak of British Modernism.

When the building was taken over by Sketch the interior was re-designed by Mazouz and Paris-based designer and sculptor Noé Duchaufour Lawrance. Several other international designers were commissioned for signature pieces, which are featured throughout sketch.&quot;

While I was having a wander around the One New Change shopping centre near St Paul's Cathedral I saw this composition of its central staircase. As most of you know, I love a good staircase and this one photographed at a different angle was something that really caught my eye. Adding to the shot an early morning shopper to give it a bit of scale and a black and white edit I think it works quite well as a bit of street photography.

I'm no expert on the subject so I'm happy for any criticism lol!!

The Carnyx is a Celtic-variant of the Etruscan and Roman bronze trumpets like the Lituus and Cornu. It was in use between c. 200 BC and c. AD 200 in Britain, France, parts of Germany, eastward to Romania and beyond. The instrument ia an an elongated S shape, with a long straight central portion, a short mouthpiece and a wider bell styled in the shape of an boar or other animal's  head.

This Carnyx is based on seven (one nearly complete) in a a first-century-BC deposit found in 2004 at Tintignac in the Corrèze department in the Nouvelle-Aquitaine region. It  was made for John Kenny by the French craftsman Jean Boisserie from hand hammered bronze.

Carnyces are a ssigned the number 423.121.12 in the Hornbostel-Sachs classification of musical instruments (<a rel=""""noreferrer nofollow""""> <a href=""""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hornbostel-Sachs"""">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hornbostel-Sachs</a> </a>), indicating:
4 = Aerophones. Sound is primarily produced by vibrating air. The instrument itself does not vibrate, and there are no vibrating strings or membranes.
42 = Non-free aerophones. The vibrating air is contained within the instrument.
423 = Trumpets. The player's vibrating lips set the air in motion.
423.1 = There are no means of changing the pitch apart from the player's lips.
423.12 = Tubular trumpets.
423.121 = End-blown trumpets. The mouth-hole faces the axis of the trumpet.
423.121.1 = End-blown straight trumpets. The tube is neither curved nor folded
423.121.12 = With mouthpiece.

I was originally enrolled into the GETTY IMAGES collection as a contributor on April 9th 2012, and when links with FLICKR were terminated in March 2014, I was retained and fortunate enough to be signed up via a second contract, both of which have proved to be successful with sales of my photographs all over the world now handled exclusively by them. 

 


On November 12th 2015 GETTY IMAGES unveiled plans for a new stills upload platform called ESP (Enterprise Submission Platform), to replace the existing 'Moment portal', and on November 13th I was invited to Beta test the new system prior to it being officially rolled out in December. ESP went live on Tuesday December 15th 2015 and has smoothed out the upload process considerably.


These days I take a far more leisurely approach to my photographic exploits, a Nikon D850 FX Pro body as my trusted companion, I travel light with less constraints and more emphasis on the pure capture of the beauty that I see, more akin to my original persuits and goals some five decades previously when starting out. I would like to say a huge and heartfelt 'THANK YOU' to GETTY IMAGES, and the 30.192+ Million visitors to my FLICKR site.

Banjos developed in the United States in the 18th and 19th century out of African instruments. They have four or five, or even six, strings and a circular drum-like sound box. Another important variation in banjos is whether they are open backed or have a resonator. 

The Minstrel Banjo of the early to mid 1800s was open backed, had a skin head and 
wooden rim, and was fretless.
The instrument in the photo is a replica of one made by Henry Stitcher of Pottsville, PA in 1848.

Minstrel  Banjos are assigned the number 321.312-5 in the Hornboste-Sachs classification of musical instruments (<a rel=""""noreferrer nofollow""""> <a href=""""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hornbostel-Sachs"""">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hornbostel-Sachs</a> </a>), indicating:
3 = Chordophone. Instruments where the sound is primarily produced by the vibration of a string or strings that are stretched between fixed points.
32 = Composite Chordophone. Acoustic and electro acoustic instruments which have a resonator as an integral part of the instrument, and solid-body electric chordophones.
321 = Lutes. Instruments where the plane of the strings runs parallel with the resonators surface.
321.3 = Handle Lutes. Instruments in which the string bearer is a plain handle.
321.31 = Spike Lutes. Instruments in which the handle passes diametrically through the resonator.
321.312 = Spike Box Lutes. Instruments in which the resonator is built up from wood.
321.312-5 = Instruments where the strings are vibrated by bare hands and fingers.

I was originally enrolled into the GETTY IMAGES collection as a contributor on April 9th 2012, and when links with FLICKR were terminated in March 2014, I was retained and fortunate enough to be signed up via a second contract, both of which have proved to be successful with sales of my photographs all over the world now handled exclusively by them. 

 


On November 12th 2015 GETTY IMAGES unveiled plans for a new stills upload platform called ESP (Enterprise Submission Platform), to replace the existing 'Moment portal', and on November 13th I was invited to Beta test the new system prior to it being officially rolled out in December. ESP went live on Tuesday December 15th 2015 and has smoothed out the upload process considerably.


These days I take a far more leisurely approach to my photographic exploits, a Nikon D850 FX Pro body as my trusted companion, I travel light with less constraints and more emphasis on the pure capture of the beauty that I see, more akin to my original persuits and goals some five decades previously when starting out. I would like to say a huge and heartfelt 'THANK YOU' to GETTY IMAGES, and the 30.050+ Million visitors to my FLICKR site.

I was originally enrolled into the GETTY IMAGES collection as a contributor on April 9th 2012, and when links with FLICKR were terminated in March 2014, I was retained and fortunate enough to be signed up via a second contract, both of which have proved to be successful with sales of my photographs all over the world now handled exclusively by them. 

 


On November 12th 2015 GETTY IMAGES unveiled plans for a new stills upload platform called ESP (Enterprise Submission Platform), to replace the existing 'Moment portal', and on November 13th I was invited to Beta test the new system prior to it being officially rolled out in December. ESP went live on Tuesday December 15th 2015 and has smoothed out the upload process considerably.


These days I take a far more leisurely approach to my photographic exploits, a Nikon D850 FX Pro body as my trusted companion, I travel light with less constraints and more emphasis on the pure capture of the beauty that I see, more akin to my original persuits and goals some five decades previously when starting out. I would like to say a huge and heartfelt 'THANK YOU' to GETTY IMAGES, and the 29.721+ Million visitors to my FLICKR site. 


***** Selected for sale in the GETTY IMAGES COLLECTION on October 21st 2018

This photograph became my 3,427th frame to be selected for sale in the Getty Images collection and I am very grateful to them for this wonderful opportunity.

The Carson J. Robison model was made by Gibson in the 1930s using the name of the Country music artist. They were sold exclusively through Montgomery Ward Department Stores. The guitar is essentially a Gibson L-00 with ladder bracing.

I was originally enrolled into the GETTY IMAGES collection as a contributor on April 9th 2012, and when links with FLICKR were terminated in March 2014, I was retained and fortunate enough to be signed up via a second contract, both of which have proved to be successful with sales of my photographs all over the world now handled exclusively by them. 

 


On November 12th 2015 GETTY IMAGES unveiled plans for a new stills upload platform called ESP (Enterprise Submission Platform), to replace the existing 'Moment portal', and on November 13th I was invited to Beta test the new system prior to it being officially rolled out in December. ESP went live on Tuesday December 15th 2015 and has smoothed out the upload process considerably.


These days I take a far more leisurely approach to my photographic exploits, a Nikon D850 FX Pro body as my trusted companion, I travel light with less constraints and more emphasis on the pure capture of the beauty that I see, more akin to my original persuits and goals some five decades previously when starting out. I would like to say a huge and heartfelt 'THANK YOU' to GETTY IMAGES, and the 29.645+ Million visitors to my FLICKR site.

****  This frame was chosen on March 15th 2019 to appear on FLICKR EXPLORE (Highest Ranking: #293.  This is my 120th photograph to be selected, which for me is both amazing and exciting, as I never view my images as worthy compared to some of the awesome photography out there. EXPLORE is Flickr's way of showcasing the most interesting photos within a given point in time -- usually over a 24 hour period.

Flickr receives about 6,000 uploads every minute -- That's about 8.6 million photos a day! From this huge group of images, the Flickr Interestingness algorithm chooses only 500 images to showcase for each 24-hour period. That's only one image in every 17,000!..... so I am really thrilled to have a frame picked and most grateful to every one of the 29.700+ Million people who have visited, favourite and commented on this and all of my other photographs here on my FLICKR site. *****

Wellington Arch, also known as Constitution Arch or (originally) as the Green Park Arch, is a Grade I-listed triumphal arch by Decimus Burton that forms a centrepiece of Hyde Park Corner in central London, between corners of Hyde Park and Green Park; it stands on a large traffic island with crossings for pedestrian access. From its construction in 1826 until 1830 the arch stood in a different location nearby; it was moved to its current site in 1882–1883. It originally supported a colossal equestrian statue of the 1st Duke of Wellington by the sculptor Matthew Cotes Wyatt, as a result of which it has acquired the name &quot;the Wellington Arch&quot; in the vernacular. This bronze quadriga (an ancient four-horse chariot) by Adrian Jones has surmounted it since 1912. 

Jones's statue is based on a smaller original which caught the eye of Edward VII at a Royal Academy exhibition. The sculpture depicts Nike, the winged goddess of victory, descending on the chariot of war, holding the classical symbol of victory and honour, a laurel wreath. The face of the charioteer leading the quadriga is that of a small boy (actually the son of Lord Michelham, who funded the sculpture). The angel of peace was modelled on Beatrice Stewart. The statue is the largest bronze sculpture in Europe. The boundary of Buckingham Palace's garden was moved south, and a new road named Duke of Wellington Place was created; this separated the space containing the Arch from the rest of the Green Park.

I was originally enrolled into the GETTY IMAGES collection as a contributor on April 9th 2012, and when links with FLICKR were terminated in March 2014, I was retained and fortunate enough to be signed up via a second contract, both of which have proved to be successful with sales of my photographs all over the world now handled exclusively by them. 

 


On November 12th 2015 GETTY IMAGES unveiled plans for a new stills upload platform called ESP (Enterprise Submission Platform), to replace the existing 'Moment portal', and on November 13th I was invited to Beta test the new system prior to it being officially rolled out in December. ESP went live on Tuesday December 15th 2015 and has smoothed out the upload process considerably.


These days I take a far more leisurely approach to my photographic exploits, a Nikon D850 FX Pro body as companion to my D7200 DX, I travel light with less constraints and more emphasis on the pure capture of the beauty that I see, more akin to my original persuits and goals some five decades previously when starting out. I would like to say a huge and heartfelt 'THANK YOU' to GETTY IMAGES, and the 28.845+ Million visitors to my FLICKR site.

32185103727,"160644704@N05","3",NA,"Natural History Museum","The Natural History Museum in London is a natural history museum that exhibits a vast range of specimens from various segments of natural history. It is one of three major museums on Exhibition Road in South Kensington, the others being the Science Museum and the Victoria and Albert Museum. The Natural History Museum's main frontage seen here, is on Cromwell Road.

The museum is home to life and earth science specimens comprising some 80 million items within five main collections: botany, entomology, mineralogy, paleontology and zoology. The museum is a centre of research specialising in taxonomy, identification and conservation. Given the age of the institution, many of the collections have great historical as well as scientific value, such as specimens collected by Charles Darwin. The museum is particularly famous for its exhibition of dinosaur skeletons and ornate architecture—sometimes dubbed a cathedral of nature—both exemplified by the large Diplodocus cast that dominated the vaulted central hall before it was replaced in 2017 with the skeleton of a blue whale hanging from the ceiling. The Natural History Museum Library contains extensive books, journals, manuscripts, and artwork collections linked to the work and research of the scientific departments; access to the library is by appointment only. The museum is recognised as the pre-eminent centre of natural history and research of related fields in the world.

Although commonly referred to as the Natural History Museum, it was officially known as British Museum (Natural History) until 1992, despite legal separation from the British Museum itself in 1963. Originating from collections within the British Museum, the landmark Alfred Waterhouse building was built and opened by 1881 and later incorporated the Geological Museum. The Darwin Centre is a more recent addition, partly designed as a modern facility for storing the valuable collections.

Like other publicly funded national museums in the United Kingdom, the Natural History Museum does not charge an admission fee. (It did but was scrapped in 2001)  The museum is an exempt charity and a non-departmental public body sponsored by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport. Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge is a patron of the museum. There are approximately 850 staff at the Museum. The two largest strategic groups are the Public Engagement Group and Science Group.

The Accordina is a hybrid instrument with aspects of the Accordion and Harmonica. Like the Harmonica it is mouth blown and has two side flaps to modulate the sound. Like the accordion it has a  chromatic keyboard (44 notes, three and a half octaves). The Accordina was conceived by André Borel of Paris in the 1930s, patented in the 1940s, and first produced in the 1950s. Only small quantities were made and this stopped in the 1970s. Only in the 1990s was the instrument revived.

This instrument was made by Joseph Carrel, one of there are three makers active currently in France 

Accordinas are assigned the number 412.132 in the Hornbostel-Sachs classification of musical instruments (<a rel=""""noreferrer nofollow""""> <a href=""""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hornbostel-Sachs"""">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hornbostel-Sachs</a> </a>), indicating:
4 = Aerophones. Sound is primarily produced by vibrating air. The instrument itself does not vibrate, and there are no vibrating strings or membranes.
41 = Free Aerophones. The vibrating air is not contained within the instrument.
412 = Interruptive Free Aerophones. The air-stream is interrupted periodically.
412.1 = Idiophonic Interruptive Aerophones or Reeds. The air-stream is directed against a lamella, setting it in periodic vibration to interrupt the stream intermittently.
412.13 = Free Reed Instruments. Instrument features a reed which vibrates within a closely fitting slot 
412.132 = Sets of Free Reads.

Stephenson hit, Dorothy (he made £100,000 from this opera), which he transferred from the Prince of Wales Theatre to open his new venue on 17 December 1888. It was the second theatre to be constructed on this stretch of Shaftesbury Avenue and is now the oldest in the street. The foyer and bars were refurbished in 1932–33, and the facade was restored in 1994. At present it seats 915 on four levels, although originally it was designed with a seating capacity of 1,306.

Early in the theatre's history, it staged mostly comic operas, and later it has been a home to light comedies, musicals and straight dramas.

The theatre retains many of its original features (including being built behind an original 1767 house front, at the rear to Great Windmill Street, the former house and museum of Sir William Hunter) and the theatre was Grade II listed by English Heritage in September 1960.

The Lyric Theatre still uses water to operate its iron curtain. Water was originally pumped from the river Thames to West End theatres and hotels and used to hydraulically operate heavy machinery like lifts. Hydraulic pressure is now provided by electric pump, but it can also be operated manually by two people.

The Lyric Theatre has been owned by Nimax Theatres since 2005 when Nica Burns and Max Weitzenhoffer purchased it from the Really Useful Group (establishing the new Nimax group with the Apollo Theatre, Garrick Theatre and Duchess Theatre).

It was developed for the 4th Earl of Southampton in the early 1660s and was initially known as Southampton Square. It was one of the earliest London squares. The Earl's own house, then known as Southampton House and later as Bedford House after the square and the rest of the Bloomsbury Estate passed by marriage from the Earls of Southampton to the Dukes of Bedford, occupied the whole of the north side of the square, where Bedford Place is now located. The other sides were lined with typical terraced houses of the time, which were initially occupied by members of the aristocracy and gentry.

On April 9, 1694, Bloomsbury Square was the setting for an infamous duel. The then 23-year-old Scottish economist and financier John Law fought Edward 'Beau' Wilson, killing him with a single pass and thrust of his sword. Law would be convicted of murder and sentenced to death, but would escape his condemned cell and go on to become the founder of the Mississippi Company and the de facto prime minister of France.

By the early 19th century, Bloomsbury was no longer fashionable with the upper classes. Consequently, the Duke of Bedford of the day moved out of Bedford House, which was demolished and replaced with further terraced houses. In the 19th century the square was occupied mainly by middle class professionals. The writer Isaac D'Israeli lived at No. 6 from 1817 to 1829 and for part of that time his son, the future Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli lived with him. In the 20th century most of the buildings came to be used as offices.

Bloomsbury Square's garden contains a bronze statue by Richard Westmacott of Charles James Fox, who was a Whig associate of the Dukes of Bedford. None of the original 17th-century buildings survive, but there are many handsome 18th- and early 19th-century houses. The Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain was based in an 18th-century building on the southern side of the square partly credited to John Nash. The eastern side of the square is occupied by a large early 20th-century office building called Victoria House, built for, and for many decades occupied by, Liverpool Victoria Friendly Society. The garden is open to the public and was refurbished in 2003.

The garden is Grade II listed on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens. [Wikipedia]","alone, bench, bloomsburysquare, flickr, garden, london, male",6,51.518427,-0.122495,"Edinburgh","Scotland","2018-10-24 11:03:56"

Opened on 24 December 1904 as the London Coliseum Theatre of Varieties, it was designed by theatrical architect Frank Matcham (designer of the London Palladium) for impresario Oswald Stoll. Their ambition was to build the largest and finest music hall, described as the &quot;people's palace of entertainment&quot; of its age.

At the time of construction, it was the only theatre in Europe that provided lifts for taking patrons to the upper levels of the house, and was the first theatre in England to have a triple revolve installed on its stage.

After being used for variety shows, musical comedies, and stage plays for many years, then as a cinema screening films in the Cinerama format between 1961 and 1968, the Sadler's Wells Opera Company moved into the building in 1968. The Sadler's Wells company changed its name to the English National Opera in 1974 and today it is used primarily for opera as well as being the London home of the English National Ballet.

English Heritage, in its description of the theatre when it was given listed status in 1960 notes that it is &quot;exuberant Free Baroque ambitious design, the Edwardian &quot;Theatre de Luxe of London&quot; with richly decorated interiors and a vast and grandiose auditorium.&quot; The description continues: &quot;Lavish foyer and circulation areas with marble facings, culminating in vast 3-tier auditorium with wealth of eclectic classical detail of Byzantine opulence, some motifs such as the squat columns dividing the lowest tier of slip boxes, backing the stalls, almost Sullivanesque; pairs of 2-tiered bow fronted boxes with domed canopies at gallery level and semi-domed, Ionic-columned pairs of 2 tiered orchestra boxes, contained in arched and pedimented frames surmounted by sculptural groups with lion-drawn chariots. Great, semi-circular, blocked architrave proscenium arch with cartouche- trophy keystone.”

The inaugural performance was a variety bill on 24 December 1904, but it &quot;was a total failure and closed down completely only two years after opening in 1906 and remained closed until December of 1907 when it was reopened and at last became successful.&quot; In 1908, the London Coliseum was host to a cricket match between Middlesex and Surrey.

In 1911, dramatist W. S. Gilbert produced his last play here, The Hooligan.

The theatre changed its name from the London Coliseum to the Coliseum Theatre between 1931 and 1968 when a run of 651 performances of the musical comedy White Horse Inn began on 8 April 1931. Additionally, Arthur Lewis notes that: “Pantomimes began in 1936 with Cinderella and continued regularly until 1946. In 1947 the musical Annie Get Your Gun was staged at the Coliseum and had a staggeringly successful run for the time, of 1,304 performances and three continuous years which was the longest run in theatrical history.” There then followed a long run of major American hits beginning with Kiss Me, Kate in 1951, Guys And Dolls in 1953, Pajama Game in 1955, and Damn Yankees in 1957. But this exceptional period did at last come to an end in 1957 when the production of The Bells Are Ringing failed to enthrall anyone.

The Coliseum reverted to the original name when the Sadler's Wells Opera Company moved there in 1968 and, in 1974, the Company changed its name to become the English National Opera; it bought the freehold of the building for £12.8 million in 1992. The Coliseum hosted both the 2004 and 2006 Royal Variety Performances and is also the London base for performances by English National Ballet, which perform regular seasons throughout the year when not on tour.


Technical aspects
While its wing space is limited due to the constricted site on which the theatre was built, as Lloyd notes, &quot;the stage of the London Coliseum was also on a vast scale; 55 feet wide by 92 feet deep&quot;. The stage is not raked. It has the widest proscenium arch in London and was one of the first to have electric lighting. It was built with a triple revolving stage, although this was rarely used. The Coliseum was designed to seat 2,358 people on four levels.

The theatre retains many of its original features and was given a Grade II* listed building by English Heritage in September 1960. Prior to Sadler's Wells Opera Company taking over the Coliseum in 1968, the house was &quot;fully restored, redecorated, and a large orchestra pit installed....On 21 August 1968, with a production of Don Giovanni&quot; opera appeared at the Coliseum.

Another extensive renovation took place between 2000 and 2004.when the design team included the architects RHWL and Arup as acousticians and building engineers.

Use As A Cinema:
Periodically, the Coliseum was used to show films and, when the &quot;'Talkies' arrived at the Coliseum in 1933, films were run at the Theatre for a year. The greatest sensation at this time was the showing of King Kong which ran at the Coliseum for months with 10,000 people seeing the film at the Theatre every day.&quot;

However, after a lackluster period of poorly received musicals came to an end, in June 1961 the theatre was leased by MGM for use as a cinema during the period that the Empire, Leicester Square was closed for rebuilding. The initial presentation, from 6 June, was a revival of Gone With the Wind which ran for 3 months. On 2 November the World Premiere of Bachelor in Paradise took place in the presence of the film's star, Bob Hope, and following this, on 15 November, was the UK premiere of Samuel Bronston's epic King of Kings. MGM continued to use the theatre even after the new Empire, Leicester Square reopened in December 1962, but MGM's lease expired on 19 May 1963 and the theatre was then leased by the Cinerama Corporation to become the second of London's Cinerama locations (after the Casino Cinerama).
Conversion to three-strip projection which used three projectors was undertaken, and an 80ft wide, 30ft tall deeply curved screen was installed. Beginning on 16 July 1963, the theatre was renamed the Coliseum Cinerama, with the UK premiere of ‘The Wonderful World of the Brothers Grimm’. This film transferred to the third of London's Cinerama houses, the Royalty Theatre on 27 November and the Coliseum was converted for single-projector Cinerama using 70mm film for the Gala UK Premiere of ‘It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad, World’ on 2 December 1963. Other 70mm films followed, The Magnificent Showman (the UK Title of Circus World), The Great Race (a 35mm &quot;blow up&quot;) and The Bible. With fewer films made in the format, it later became difficult to programme the theatre. It resorted to revivals of old 70mm movies before opening The Comedians on January 18 1968 (a 70mm Panavision blow up). This ran for nine weeks and was followed by a revival of the 1956 Todd-AO epic ‘Around the World in 80 Days’, the first time this film had been shown in 70mm in London. This ran until 22 May 1968 when Cinerama pulled out and the theatre reverted to live use.

It was laid out in the 1630s under the initiative of the speculative builder and contractor William Newton, &quot;the first in a long series of entrepreneurs who took a hand in developing London&quot;, as Sir Nikolaus Pevsner observes. The original plan for &quot;laying out and planting&quot; these fields, drawn by the hand of Inigo Jones, was said still to be seen in Lord Pembroke's collection at Wilton House in the 19th century, but is untraced. The grounds, which had remained private property, were acquired by London County Council in 1895. It is today managed by the London Borough of Camden and forms part of the southern boundary of that borough with the City of Westminster.

Lincoln's Inn Fields takes its name from the adjacent Lincoln's Inn, of which the private gardens are separated from the Fields by a perimeter wall and a large gatehouse.

The grassed area in the centre of the Fields contains a court for tennis and netball and a bandstand. It was previously used for corporate events, which are no longer permitted. Cricket and other sports are thought to have been played here in the 18th century.

The park is set on a hillside and offers views across the City of London. It has three ponds all fed by natural springs.  The land has been laid out as gardens since the seventeenth century and contains many mature trees.

Lauderdale House which is at the edge of the park, is used as a tea room and for functions and arts events and is surrounded by formal gardens. It is a much modified very old timber framed house, dating back to the sixteenth century. None of the interior remains in its original state. It was the home of the notorious Earl (later Duke) of Lauderdale in the 17th century. There is a local tradition that Nell Gwyn, the mistress of King Charles II lived there at a later date.

The poet Andrew Marvell lived in another nearby house which was once within the bounds of the park. One of his poems is displayed on a bronze plaque in the park.  Another house once within the park was the home of the architect Sir James Pennethorne.

It suffered years of neglect and vandalism but was restored with a grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund. It reopened in 2005 and is now managed by the London Borough of Camden. [Wikipedia]","flickr, london, waterlowpark",15,51.568894,-0.143125,"Edinburgh","Scotland","2018-10-23 11:46:41"

The Chromatic Accordion is a type of button accordion where the right-side keyboard consists of rows of buttons arranged chromatically (in minor thirds along the length of the keyboard, and in half steps going across on the diagonal). It is unisonic producing the same note when the bellows are pushed and pulled. The chromatic accordion was created in the 1850s in Austria by F. Walter who rearranged the reeds on a 3-row Diactonic Accordion.

A free bass system is a system of bass buttons which give the performer greater access to playing melodies with their left hand instead of the standard Stradella  which only allows bass notes. The are several different systems including &quot;converter&quot; models with a control to switch from standard Stradella to free-bass. The free bass system is found on both Chromatic and Piano accordions.

This instrument is a 1963 Victoria Ac420V free-bass Accordion which Richard Galliano has played for 50 years. It is C-system CBA on the right hand side and Quint system on the left.

Chromatic Accordions are assigned the number 412.132 in the Hornbostel-Sachs classification of musical instruments (<a rel=""""noreferrer nofollow""""> <a href=""""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hornbostel-Sachs"""">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hornbostel-Sachs</a> </a>), indicating:
4 = Aerophones. Sound is primarily produced by vibrating air. The instrument itself does not vibrate, and there are no vibrating strings or membranes.
41 = Free Aerophones. The vibrating air is not contained within the instrument.
412 = Interruptive Free Aerophones. The air-stream is interrupted periodically.
412.1 = Idiophonic Interruptive Aerophones or Reeds. The air-stream is directed against a lamella, setting it in periodic vibration to interrupt the stream intermittently.
412.13 = Free Reed Instruments. Instrument features a reed which vibrates within a closely fitting slot 
412.132 = Sets of Free Reads.

Tenor Banjos have a shorter neck than the standard banjo, four strings, and a usually played with a plectrum. They developed in the 1910s-20s and were used as a rhythm instrument in dance bands and early jazz. It was introduced to Irish traditional music in the USA by performers like the Flanagan Brothers. In Ireland after the banning of house parties, the Tenor Banjo became part of the instrumentation of ceili bands in the parish halls. In the 1960s folk revival both the Dubliners and the Clancy Brothers used the Banjo. While less common than the Guitar or the Bouzouki, it can still be heard today.

This instrument is a Clareen Tenor Banjo. Tom Cussen (the banjo player with Shaskeen) opened Clareen Banjos based in Clarinbridge, Co. Galway in the early 1980s.

Tenor Banjos are assigned the number 321.312-6 in the Hornbostel-Sachs classification of musical instruments (<a rel=""""noreferrer nofollow""""> <a href=""""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hornbostel-Sachs"""">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hornbostel-Sachs</a> </a>), indicating:
3 = Chordophone. Instruments where the sound is primarily produced by the vibration of a string or strings that are stretched between fixed points.
32 = Composite Chordophone. Acoustic and electro-acoustic instruments which have a resonator as an integral part of the instrument, and solid-body electric chordophones.
321 = Lutes. Instruments where the plane of the strings runs parallel with the resonator’s surface.
321.3 = Handle Lutes. Instruments in which the string bearer is a plain handle.
321.31 = Spike Lutes. Instruments in which the handle passes diametrically through the resonator.
321.312 = Spike Box Lutes. Instruments in which the resonator is built up from wood.
321.312-5 = Instruments where the strings are vibrated by bare hands and fingers.
321.312-6 = Instruments where the Strings vibrated by a plectrum.

The Mandocello first appeared in Italy as part of the Mandolin family of instruments. It was taken up by the Gibson company in the USA with a series of models made from 1902 until 1936. They had a flat rather than an arched back, and at first A Style bodies before turning to an F Style one. The Mandocello is tuned an octave below the mandola. In shape and size it was similar to a modern long scale Irish Bouzouki.

Garry O'Briain is an instrument maker as well as a musician, so this mandocello was very probably made by him in New Quay County Clare.

Mandocellos are assigned the number 321.321 in the Hornbostel-Sachs classification of musical instruments (<a rel=""""noreferrer nofollow""""> <a href=""""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hornbostel-Sachs"""">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hornbostel-Sachs</a> </a>), indicating:
3 = Chordophone. Instruments where the sound is primarily produced by the vibration of a string or strings that are stretched between fixed points.
32 = Composite Chordophone. Acoustic and electro acoustic instruments which have a resonator as an integral part of the instrument, and solid body electric chordophones.
321 = Lutes. Instruments where the plane of the strings runs parallel with the resonators surface.
321.3 = Handle Lutes. Instruments in which the string bearer is a plain handle.
321.32 = Necked Lutes. Instrument in which the handle is attached to, or carved from, the resonator, like a neck.
321.321 = Necked Bowl Lutes. Instrument with a resonator made from a bowl, either natural or carved.

46371880754,"80832649@N00","3",NA,"Millennium Footbridge, Thames Embankment, London SE1, UK","The Millennium Bridge, officially the 'London Millennium Footbridge', links Bankside (this side; the viewpoint is the tree-lined plaza outside the Tate Modern art gallery) to the City of London (far bank).  The steel suspension pedestrian bridge is evidently aligned to have a terminating vista of St. Paul's Cathedral; but you knew that, from countless tourist photos.
Designed by Sir Anthony Caro (sculptor), Foster &amp; Partners (architects), and Arup Group (engineers), with its suspension cables below deck level to meet height restrictions and improve views, the 325 m long bridge was built 1998&ndash;2000, making it the first new bridge across the Thames in London for more than a century.
Ninety thousand people visited on the opening day, with up to 2,000 on the bridge at any one time. That's 3,000 fewer than the design allowed, but it still revealed an unforeseen resonant response. A slight sway of the deck caused peoples gaits to synchronise, causing a <em>severe</em> sway of the deck which immediately closed the bridge for two years of additional work to add motion dampers. Embarassing and expensive, but it's great now.

The riverside complex to the left of the bridge is all the City of London (boys) School, founded in 1824 and on this site since 1986.  The riverside buildings to the right are all modern, primarily offices with a few restaurants. The string of lights indicates the Thames Path.

The large clocktower at the left is at the west end of St Paul's, but in front and to the left is the smaller tower of the Welsh Anglican church of St Benet Paul's Wharf.
First built in 1111 and dedicated to St Benedict, it became the official church of the College of Arms in 1556. Destroyed in the Great Fire of 1666, this replacement was designed by Sir Christopher Wren. Surprisingly, it survived the Second World War undamaged, one of only four City Churches to do so.

St Paul's Cathedral stands on Ludgate Hill at the heart of the City of London. A church dedicated to St. Paul has occupied the site since 604, but Sir Christopher Wren's English Baroque masterpiece, the fourth cathedral on the site, was built after the 1666 Great Fire of London, being (officially) completed in 1711.  The tallest building in London until 1962, St Paul's remains the second largest (by volume) church in the UK, with one of the highest (at 111 m tall) and 'most perfect' domes in the world.  Aside from being a true icon of London, it's the nearest the UK has to a 'national' church, having been the venue of key funerals, weddings and commemorations of British history.","millennium, bridge, river, thames, city, london, se1, uk, stpauls, cathedral, bankside, rnbthames, cityoflondon, church, tower, wren, stbenet, paulswharf, dome, footbridge, light, night, shore, longexposure",7,51.50849,-0.098755,"Lancaster","UK","2017-02-25 20:23:47"

The area is a prominent example of 1970s British brutalist architecture, redeveloping an area devasted by WWII bombings. The concrete estate consists of several tower blocks, terraces, grouped around a lake and green squares. Today, the estate also hosts The Barbican Centre, the largest performing arts center of its kind in Europe. Every day, as I commute between the concrete buildings, I never cease to be amazed by photographic opportunities and creative compositions offered by this type of architecture!

Wow, its been sometime hasn't it? I have not uploaded here in such a while and I see Flickr has changed a little bit since I was last here.

I have tried adding the Geolocation but it seems that its broken on Flickr, I can't seem to add it, it says its there but is not showing. Also my comments don't appear to be showing so sorry if I don't get back to you straight away.

Don't worry I still have all my photography gear, I just have had a long break away from photography. Living up North away from London now makes it more difficult to get down to the Capital to get new material although now I have a visit down there at some point in the near future.

.


I was originally enrolled as a SHUTTERSTOCK contributor on January 28th 2019. Shutterstock is an American stock photography company with headquarters in New York City, founded in 2003 by Photographer Jon Oringer. With a library in excess of 200 million royalty free stock photographs, I am delighted, and most grateful to have been accepted into the fold.

Having been passionate about photography since the age of seven years old, with a box brownie and black and white 120 roll film, these days I take a far more leisurely approach to my photographic exploits, a Nikon D850 FX Pro body as my trusted companion, I travel light with less constraints and more emphasis on the pure capture of the beauty that I see, more akin to my original persuits and goals some five decades previously when starting out. I would like to say a huge and heartfelt 'THANK YOU' to GETTY IMAGES, SHUTTERSTOCK, and the 28.300+ Million visitors to my FLICKR site. 


***** Selected for sale in the SHUTTERSTOCK COMMERCIAL COLLECTION Image ID:1309719724 on February 14th 2019.


This photograph became my 145th frame to be selected for sale on SHUTTERSTOCK, and I am very grateful to them for this wonderful opportunity.

Photograph taken at an altitude of Nineteen metres, at 09:40am on Thursday 24th April 2014 off Paternoster Square, beside St Paul's Cathedral of The Paternoster Column, in Central London, England.


Designed by Whitfield Partners in 2003, and constructed of Portland stone, Cornish granite and gilded copper,   the Paternoster Column stands Twenty three metres  tall and is part of a ventilation system for the traffic gyratory and the car park beneath. The column itself is a recreation of those designed by Inigo Jones for the west portico of the old St Paul's.


Running through the central service hole of the column are a lightening conductor and fibre optic cables for night-lighting of the urn, which was designed to provide a visual reference to a fire beacon, and thus fulfil the columns purpose as a marker.The urn also reflects the finials on the west towers of todays St Paul's and commemorates the fact that the site has been destroyed twice by fire - the Great Fire of 1666 and the Blitz of WWII.

I was originally enrolled as a SHUTTERSTOCK contributor on January 28th 2019. Shutterstock is an American stock photography company with headquarters in New York City, founded in 2003 by Photographer Jon Oringer. With a library in excess of 200 milliuon royalty free stock photographs, I am delighted, and most grateful to have been accepted into the fold.

Having been passionate about photography since the age of seven years old, with a box brownie and black and white 120 roll film, these days I take a far more leisurely approach to my photographic exploits, a Nikon D850 FX Pro body as my trusted companion, I travel light with less constraints and more emphasis on the pure capture of the beauty that I see, more akin to my original persuits and goals some five decades previously when starting out. I would like to say a huge and heartfelt 'THANK YOU' to GETTY IMAGES, SHUTTERSTOCK, and the 27.312+ Million visitors to my FLICKR site. 


***** Selected for sale in the SHUTTERSTOCK COMMERCIAL COLLECTION Image ID:1301101810 on February 1st 2019.


This photograph became my 16th frame to be selected for sale on SHUTTERSTOCK, and I am very grateful to them for this wonderful opportunity.

Photograph taken at an altitude of Fifty six metres, at 09:28am on Thursday 24th April 2014 off Cheapside and St Paul's Churchyard, beneath the gilded Paul's Cross Memorial Statue in the grounds of St Paul's Cathedral.  


The Cathedral was designed by architects Sir Christopher Wren and Lorenzo Gafa, with construction commencing in 1675 and the official opening in 1708. It stands One hundred and eleven metres tall and is a Church of England cathedral, the seat of the Bishop of London and Mother Church of the Diocese of London, It sits at the top of Ludgate Hill, the highest point in the City of London and was the tallest building in London from 1710 to 1962


The first mention of a Christian building on this site was in 604, when a monastery was built here and dedicated to St. Paul. The current building was built after the Great Fire of London in 1666 destroyed the old cathedral


Paul’s Cross was an open-air pulpit that from the earliest times was traditionally seen as the place for the discussion of public news and orders. In 1259, it was here that King Henry III called for a general assembly to be made where certain Londoners were gathered at the Cross to swear their allegiance to Henry

From the IWM website: 
The left-hand gun (Gunbody No. 125) of the pair situated outside Imperial War Museum London was made by William Beardmore and mounted in HMS Ramillies in 1916. It was first fired in action against Turkish shore targets during operations in the Sea of Marmara in 1920. Apart from practice shoots, it was not fired again until 17 August 1940, when when a British force bombarded Bardia in North Africa. HMS Ramillies also fired several salvoes during the Battle of Spartivento in 27 November 1940. The Italian warships were out of range and no hits were scored. The gun was removed from HMS Ramillies in 1941 and stored. The tampion badge is taken from the arms of the Duke of Marlborough, and translates as 'Faithful but Unfortunate'. 

The right-hand gun (Gunbody No. 102) was mounted in HMS Resolution from 1915 to 1938. It saw service in the Sea of Marmara in 1920, but was not fired in anger again until 1944, and then in another ship, the monitor Roberts. This ship was an important unit in the naval forces assembled for the invasion of Normandy. On D-Day itself, HMS Roberts bombarded Houlgate Battery, east of Sword Beach. During the succeeding weeks her guns shelled enemy positions several miles inland near Caen. On 1 November 1944 she supported the assault on Walcheren and attacked a German battery north of Westkapelle","",23,51.496851,-0.108597,NA,"UK","2014-03-05 16:33:17"

40544264620,"149636765@N04","3",NA,"The Chaldon Doom Mural","The tiny Norman church of St Peter and St Paul stands almost forgotten down a quiet country lane, looking out onto farm fields, on the western fringe of Chaldon, only a mile inside the M25 ring road. Yet within this small building is one of the finest early medieval treasures in England, a wall painting created at the turn of the 13th century, depicting the Last Judgement and taking up almost the entire west wall of the nave. This is the earliest known wall painting in the country and probably dates to 1200AD.
History 
The earliest church at Chaldon was recorded in a charter dated 727AD and was associated with the Abbey of Chertsey. The timber structure may have been built as early as 675AD. The current church was built in the late 10th or early 11th century, with a simple rectangular nave and the high walls characteristic of Saxon architecture. Of that Saxon building the west wall is original, and the wall pierced by the chancel arch may be as well. There was certainly a church here at the time of the Domesday Book, which mentions 'Chalvedune' possessing 200 acres of land and a church. The church remained connected with Chertsey Abbey until the Dissolution of the Monasteries under Henry VIII. In the early 13th century a south aisle was added to the Saxon structure, inserting Early English arches into the Saxon nave wall. The chancel arch was inserted at roughly the same time, with a similar north aisle added 50 years later.
The major feature in the chancel is a large Easter Sepulchre, dating to the 15th century and taking up much of the north wall. This is decorated with blank shields and quatrefoil carvings. Near the Easter Sepulchre is a wall tablet in Renaissance style, dated 1562 and probably commemorating the Richardson family of Chaldon. The tablet is carved with an invocation to be generous to he poor; one phrase calling on all men and women 'To be ever good to The poore and nedy[sic]'. On the south wall is a memorial to Christian Home (d. 1752) who certainly lived an eventful life; she was borin in Scotland, sailed to Jamaica, where she was shipwrecked. She survived the wreck, and is buried with her husband John nearby. 

Off the south aisle is St Kateryn's Chapel, bult in the 14th century and now acting as a Lady Chapel. A stained glass window and plaque act as a memorial to the Lambert family, while the north aisle opposite has a window to the Gardiners of Rockshaw. 

The oak pulpit is in Jacobean style but actually dates from 1657, making it a rare example from the Cromwellian period. Hanging in the south aisle is a plaster cast of a medieval bell; the original, one of the oldest bells in Surrey, was stollen in 1970. The font is unusual, made of Merstham stone, with a square bowl standing on an octagonal stem. in the porch is a broken 12th century coffin lid.

The west wall is almost covered by this superb example of medieval art. The Chaldon paintings are thought to be the work of a travelling monk well-versed in Greek art. The vividly coloured painting shows the Biblical Day of Judgement, with a central Ladder of Salvation making a cross shape with Purgatory above and Hell below. The painting is made of yellow ochre and red ochre, and spans just over 17 feet across and is over 11 feet high. It was whitewashed during the Commonwealth period and only discovered in 1869 during restoration work. Rev Henry Shepherd, the Rector, noticed colour as the walls were being made ready for lime-washing. Thankfully he stopped the work to investigate, but not before further paintings on the north wall arch were destroyed. The paintings were initially cleaned by the Surrey Archaeological Society, and later 'preserved' with a wax coating. Over time the wax caused discolouration, so it was removed in 1989 and the paintings restored to their original splendour.
And splendour is the right word; they truly are breathtaking to see. The scene is dotted with wicked imps and demons, designed to tell the story of humanity's day of reckoning to a largely illiterate audience. In the lower right is the Garden of Eden with the 'tree of the knowledge of good and evil' and Satan in the form of a serpent tempting Adam and Eve. One interesting bit of social commentary is a Bridge of Spikes, which dishonest tradesmen are forced to cross. Tradesmen depited include a blacksmith, potter, spinners, and a mason. Were these trades deemed more untrustworthy than others? We are left in no doubt how money-lenders are regarded, for one stands beneath the bridge, swallowed by flames, money pouring from his mouth. He is flanked by figures of lust and envy, while other figures representing the Seven Deadly Sins are scattered throughout the scene. Figures ascend and descend the ladder to salvation while demons pluck at them. A drunken pilgrim lies at the feet of a demon, while devils throw murderers into a cauldron. It is interesting that the demons have three or four toes, all save one, whjo has cloven feet. Satan again?
At the lower left is Michael the Archangel weighing deeds while a devil tries to put extra weight on the evil side of the scales. Angels lead the tHree Marys to heaven, while a penitent thief is carried up by another angel. In the lower right are the Gates of Hell, represented by a demon with gaping jaws. One later addition to the painting is a consecration cross on the lower left edge. On a column by the south door is a second cross, over a 'T' monogram representing St Thomas Becket, probably left by a pilgrim. 

The Chaldon paintings are easy to describe, but the description cannot do them justice. They truly are superb, a word often misused, but in this case easily justified. They are a national treasure, and it is exciting to think that the church is usually open so that travellers or even modern pilgrims can appreciate them.

NEWS EXTRA! ( Re-release No.8) -5 May 2018
 
This is one of over 30 of my Flickr pictures which had ended up as &quot;private&quot; without any intervention whatsoever on my part. In the process, all the &quot;favourites&quot; and other data has been lost.
 
As some of you may know, I have a long-running &quot;Breaking News&quot; series where I keep track of my picture viewings as they reach 1,000, ad seriatim, and bring them them to the fore as and when the viewings have exceeded that number. Until, this happened, I knew whether a picture was the 100th, 500th, 712th or whatever picture to hit that &quot;magic number&quot;. Not any any more.
This one, which was first posted in September 2015, has yet to join the &quot;1,000 Club&quot;.

Flickr thinks that the cause of the problem has something to do with the Flickr / Light Room interface. If that is the case, I surely cannot be the only person affected.","south, bank, london, scottish, kilt, thames, river, lunch, ipd, apple, ear, pieces, eat, lunchbox, couple, man, woman, hat, bench",3,51.508074,-0.114562,NA,NA,"2014-02-25 14:48:37"

The Clarendon family left The Grove in the 1920s, when it was used as a gardening school, a health centre (National Institute Of Nutrition and College Of Dietetics), a riding school, and a girls' boarding school. It was the wartime headquarters of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway company, and then a management training centre for the British Transport Commission and later British Rail. The estate was sold in 1996 to Ralph Trustees Ltd, which extended the property and converted it to a luxury hotel.
Also, The Grove is one of England's finest luxury golf courses. ","grove, hotel, watford, hertfordshire, england, clarendon, golf, golfcourse, nikon, d800e, nikond800e",24,51.677611,-0.43147,NA,NA,"2014-04-17 11:40:00"

Construction started:  1978
Completed: 18. Nov. 1986
Architects: Richard Rogers and Partners 
The building at the Lime Street is the head office of the insurance institution &quot;Lloyd's of London&quot;.
This approach of outwardly demonstrative technologyIn in the  Lloyd's Building Richard Rogers continued also in his later high-rise constructions. This unconventional construction was surprisingly close to the futurists' visions (=&gt; Centre Pompidou, Paris). 

Rogers's proposal for the new Lloyd's building was just as controversial as his co-designed Centre Pompidou in Paris, due to its so-called High Tech style design, where functional elements such as pipes are moved to the outside of the building to create more interior space.
The exterior is more refined than that of Centre Pompidou however, with polished stainless steel and glass instead of a cacophony of colors.  
Nonetheless, when Richard Rogers's design was shown to the public in 1978 it caused quite a controversy as it contrasted sharply with the centuries old buildings in the area and in particular the adjacent historic Leadenhall Market.

The construction of The Walbrook Building commenced in the summer of 2007 and was completed in February 2010. 
The Walbrook Building leads the way with cutting edge design combined with a host of energy efficient features that takes building construction firmly into the 21st century. Designing a drainage system that would blend with the building’s striking curved façade to convey rainwater efficiently, posed a real challenge for drainage specialists <a href=""""http://www.aco.com/deutsch/aco-gruppe/familienunternehmen.html"""" rel=""""noreferrer nofollow"""">ACO</a> Building Drainage.
Situated in the heart of the city, The Walbrook Building lies in a prominent position directly opposite Cannon Street station and adjacent to Christopher Wren’s church of St Stephen Walbrook. This landmark ninestorey building was developed by Minerva Plc and designed by internationally renowned architects Foster + Partners and comprises in total some 445'000 square feet (41'300 m2) of air-conditioned offices, incorporating two atria together with premium retail areas.  
The architects wanted a reliable rainwater drainage system at ground level that would complement the contemporary design of the building. So they turned to drainage specialists ACO Building Drainage to provide a system that was both efficient and would reflect the styling and architectural quality of the building’s unique curved exterior façade.

.


I was originally enrolled into the GETTY IMAGES collection as a contributor on April 9th 2012, and when links with FLICKR were terminated in March 2014, I was retained and fortunate enough to be signed up via a second contract, both of which have proved to be successful with sales of my photographs all over the world now handled exclusively by them. 

 


On November 12th 2015 GETTY IMAGES unveiled plans for a new stills upload platform called ESP (Enterprise Submission Platform), to replace the existing 'Moment portal', and on November 13th I was invited to Beta test the new system prior to it being officially rolled out in December. (ESP went live on Tuesday December 15th 2015 and has smoothed out the upload process considerably).


With visits now in excess of 19.481 Million to my FLICKR site, used primarily these days as a fun platform to reach friends and family as I have now sold my professional gear and now take a more leisurely approach to my photographic exploits, I would like to say a huge and heartfelt 'THANK YOU' to FLICKR, GETTY IMAGES and everyone who drops by.


***** Selected for sale in the GETTY IMAGES COLLECTION on March 6th 2017

I was originally enrolled into the GETTY IMAGES collection as a contributor on April 9th 2012, and when links with FLICKR were terminated in March 2014, I was retained and fortunate enough to be signed up via a second contract, both of which have proved to be successful with sales of my photographs all over the world now handled exclusively by them. 

 


On November 12th 2015 GETTY IMAGES unveiled plans for a new stills upload platform called ESP (Enterprise Submission Platform), to replace the existing 'Moment portal', and on November 13th I was invited to Beta test the new system prior to it being officially rolled out in December. (ESP went live on Tuesday December 15th 2015 and has smoothed out the upload process considerably).


With visits now in excess of 18.242 Million to my FLICKR site, used primarily these days as a fun platform to reach friends and family as I have now sold my professional gear and now take a more leisurely approach to my photographic exploits, I would like to say a huge and heartfelt 'THANK YOU' to FLICKR, GETTY IMAGES and everyone who drops by.

Hurray, it seems yesterdays problems with Flickr not putting Geo Tagging data and missing comments are now fixed and resolved.

This tunnel is simply awesome, I had to wait an age to get this image and the right person to walk into the frame. I remember when this tunnel opened about 5 years ago now that it was the in-place for photographers to photo and I can see why, the lit up wall that you see on the right hand side is mesmerising, I could have stayed there for ages just watching it.

Oh also I am active on Instagram if anyone wants to add me on there too, just click the link below to go to my Instagram, I am known as &quot;TheUndergroundPerson&quot; if you want to search for me instead.

From Dezeen website : &quot;A monumental car park building close to London's Oxford Street is being sold, meaning it could now be demolished to make way for a new hotel.

Featuring an elaborate facade of prefabricated concrete diamonds, the Welbeck Street car park was once selected by architect and Dezeen columnist Sam Jacob as one of the most important unsung buildings in the capital.

But the Brutalist-era building is now being sold to developer Shiva Hotels in a reported £100 million deal, putting it at risk of demolition.

The 1970s structure had recently been denied a listing from government heritage body Historic England, and was put up for sale by previous owner LaSalle Investment Management shortly afterwards.

The site had been valued at £30 million at the end of 2014. But a recent report from property company Pastor Real Estate named it as one of 18 London car park sites with potential to increase in value by 300 per cent.

&quot;The car park on Welbeck Street provides an annual return of £109.5 million for its 360 spaces, whilst a residential scheme located on the prime Marylebone site has the potential to be worth £406 million,&quot; reads the report.&quot;

It was originally intended to hold an equestrian statue of William IV, but remained bare due to insufficient funds. For over 150 years the fate of the plinth was debated; in 1998, the Royal Society for the encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce (RSA) commissioned three contemporary sculptures to be displayed temporarily on the plinth. Shortly afterwards, Chris Smith, Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, commissioned Sir John Mortimer to seek opinions from public art commissioners, critics and members of the public as to the future of the plinth. Mortimer's final report recommended that the commissions remain a rolling programme of temporary artworks rather than settle permanently on one figure or idea to commemorate. In 2003, the ownership of Trafalgar Square was transferred from Westminster City Council to the Mayor of London and this marked the beginning of the Mayor of London's Fourth Plinth Commission as it is now known.

The cockerel stood on the fourth plinth from 25 July 2013 – 17 February 2015

The Barbican condemned the protesters who caused the cancellation of the anti-slavery exhibition showing black actors in chains and in cages. 
A Barbican spokesperson said. “It became impossible for us to continue with the show because of the extreme nature of the protest and the serious threat to the safety of performers, audiences and staff “Given that protests are scheduled for future performances of Exhibit B we have had no choice but to cancel all performances of the piece. We find it profoundly troubling that such methods have been used to silence artists and performers, and that audiences have been denied the opportunity to see this important work. 
“Exhibit B raises, in a serious and responsible manner, issues about racism; it has previously been shown in 12 cities, involved 150 performers and been seen by around 25,000 people with the responses from participants, audiences and critics alike being overwhelmingly positive.” 
The Barbican said strenuous efforts had been made to save the exhibition. “We respect people’s right to protest but are disappointed that this was not done in a peaceful way as had been previously promised by campaigners,” the spokesperson said. “We believe this piece should be shown in London and are disturbed at the potential implications this silencing of artists and performers has for freedom of expression.” 
The campaign against the exhibition was led by Birmingham-based activist and journalist Sara Myers but drew support from around the country, including noted figures such as Lord Boateng, Britain’s first black cabinet minister. 
Simon Woolley, coordinator of Operation Black Vote and a former Equalities and Human Rights Commissioner, said efforts were made to communicate to the Barbican the strength of feeling. “They underestimated it. They failed to see people’s anger at being exploited in this way,” he said. “This was a vanity project. Having people objectified in this humiliating way was always going to cause a fierce reaction. It is a shame that it reached this stage but the feeling was that no one was listening.” 
Reacting to the Barbican’s claim that the protest was not peaceful, demonstrators pointed out that police at the scene left without making any arrests. 
The installation arrived in the capital to artistic acclaim. Peter Brook described it as “an extraordinary achievement”. A review in the Guardian said the South African artist’s work was “unbearable and essential”. 

The Barbican billed the work as a valuable contribution to debate. “Exhibit B critiques the ‘human zoos’ and ethnographic displays that showed Africans as objects of scientific curiosity through the 19th and early 20th centuries.” 
The 12 tableaux, featured “motionless performers placed in settings drawn from real life”. Together, it said, the images “confront colonial atrocities committed in Africa, European notions of racial supremacy and the plight of immigrants today”. 
Among the strongest supporters of the project were some of the actors involved. Prior to Tuesday’s protest, they met demonstrators but neither side was able to convince the other. In a statement seeking to calm the controversy, they said: “We find this piece to be a powerful tool in the fight against racism. Individually, we chose to do this piece because art impacts people on a deeper emotional level that can spark change. 
“The exhibit does not allow for any member of the audience – white, black or otherwise – to disassociate themselves from a system that contains racism within it. We are proud to be black.

I'm stampolina and I love to take photos of stamps. Thanks for visiting this pages on flickr.

I'm neither a typical collector of stamps, nor a stamp dealer. I'm only a stamp photograph. I'm fascinated of the fine close-up structures which are hidden in this small stamp-pictures. Please don't ask of the worth of these stamps - the most ones have a worth of a few cents or still less. 

<b>By the way,  I wanna say thank you to all flickr users who have sent me stamps! Great! Thank you!</b> Someone sent me 3 or 5 stamps, another one sent me more than 20 stamps in a letter. It's everytime a great surprise for me and I'm everytime happy to get letters with stamps inside from you! 
thx, stampolina

For the case you wanna send also stamps - it is possible. (...I'm pretty sure you'll see these stamps on this photostream on flickr :) thx!

Sadly I think this structures days are numbered as the site is threatened with redevelopment.

From Dezeen website : &quot;A monumental car park building close to London's Oxford Street is being sold, meaning it could now be demolished to make way for a new hotel.

Featuring an elaborate facade of prefabricated concrete diamonds, the Welbeck Street car park was once selected by architect and Dezeen columnist Sam Jacob as one of the most important unsung buildings in the capital.

But the Brutalist-era building is now being sold to developer Shiva Hotels in a reported £100 million deal, putting it at risk of demolition.

The 1970s structure had recently been denied a listing from government heritage body Historic England, and was put up for sale by previous owner LaSalle Investment Management shortly afterwards.

The site had been valued at £30 million at the end of 2014. But a recent report from property company Pastor Real Estate named it as one of 18 London car park sites with potential to increase in value by 300 per cent.

&quot;The car park on Welbeck Street provides an annual return of £109.5 million for its 360 spaces, whilst a residential scheme located on the prime Marylebone site has the potential to be worth £406 million,&quot; reads the report.&quot;

Die Cutty Sark ist ein englischer Tee- und Wollklipper. Sie wurde im Jahre 1869 fertiggestellt und war eines der schnellsten Segelschiffe ihrer Zeit. Sie war der letzte Klipper, der für den Seehandel gebaut wurde. 1954 wurde sie in einem speziellen Trockendock in Greenwich, London, als Museumsschiff aufgelegt, brannte jedoch im Mai 2007 nahezu vollständig ab. Nach der Restaurierung wurde sie am 25. April 2012 wiedereröffnet.

Situated in St Martin’s Lane, WC2, the entrance to the church faces Trafalgar Square and the National Gallery.
The year 1222 is the earliest reference to the church, however there is not much known about it until 1542, when, in the reign of Henry VIII, he had it rebuilt.  Apparently to house plague victims and prevent them from passing through the Palace of Westminster.
In 1606 the building was enlarged, being built over the old graveyard.  This was in the reign of James I, at the same time the old part of the church was fully renovated.  Sometime later in the 1600’s galleries were added to increase the size of the congregation.  Nell Gwynne was buried there.
During the eighteenth century funds were allocated to build new church, the architect James Gibbs was chosen to do the work.  Between 1722, when the foundation stone was laid and 1724, the work was completed.  The spire rises to 59mtrs (192 ft in old money).  Although not popular in design at the time, this template has been used on many notable churches over the world.   St Andrews church in Glasgow, and St Andrews church in Chennai, India.
The church is now famous for its work with the homeless and youth.  It also has many concerts as well as jazz sessions in the Crypt.
The east window was designed by Shirazeh Houshiary and Pip Horne, it was manufactured by Michael Mayer of Munich.  It reminds me of Edmund Munch’s ‘The Scream’.

&quot;Previously called the Long House, it was built for Daniel Pidgeon in 1892: Pigeon's initials were displayed on the stonework and lead-work outside as well as on internal fittings.
After he died on holiday at Aswan, his widow leased the house to tenants, beginning with the Klinker family, piano importers and Abraham Dixon, while Cherkley Court was being restored after a fire in 1893.
The Right Hon Sir Frederick Milner (1849-1931) had been a Member of Parliament and Privy Councillor, but was forced to retire in 1906 by increasing deafness.
He fought tirelessly to improve the treatment of injured troops returning from the wars. One result was the creation of the Ministry of Pensions, with whom Milner conducted an incessant paper war.
He founded a hostel in Beckenham, set up a number of village settlements and started the Ex-Services Welfare Society. His particular interest was in &quot;shell-shocked&quot; servicemen, who often faced execution by firing squad for failing to obey orders; at best they would be confined in pauper lunatic asylums for life.
In 1926 the Ex-Services Welfare Society bought the Long House as its second rest and treatment Centre, renaming it The Sir Frederick Milner Home and turning it round so that the front door became the back. Cottages were built nearby for married couples. No special medical care was given, but the sheltered environment included a market garden and workshops, operated on commercial lines and paying a living wage.&quot;

&quot;Milner House, originally known as the Long House, was built 1891. A Grade 2 building originally owed by Daniel Pidgeon (DP initials are on show all around the building). He died in Egypt in 1900. It was next lived in by the Klinker family 1901 - many pictures to be seen. In the 1930's it was owned by Sir Frederick Milner who used the magnificent house to its full potential, receiving all sorts of guests including The Duke and Duchess of York, later to become King and Queen. It was a convalescent home in his latter years helping servicemen of all sorts and employing a vast staff from the local area. In 1981 in was turned into a nursing home by Ashbourne Homes and is currently run by Care UK ... &quot;

This is where my mother spent the last few days of her life.
The last time I was here was in May 2011,
the evening they phoned us to tell us she'd died.

Situated in St Martin’s Lane, WC2, the entrance to the church faces Trafalgar Square and the National Gallery.
The year 1222 is the earliest reference to the church, however there is not much known about it until 1542, when, in the reign of Henry VIII, he had it rebuilt.  Apparently to house plague victims and prevent them from passing through the Palace of Westminster.
In 1606 the building was enlarged, being built over the old graveyard.  This was in the reign of James I, at the same time the old part of the church was fully renovated.  Sometime later in the 1600’s galleries were added to increase the size of the congregation.  Nell Gwynne was buried there.
During the eighteenth century funds were allocated to build new church, the architect James Gibbs was chosen to do the work.  Between 1722, when the foundation stone was laid and 1724, the work was completed.  The spire rises to 59mtrs (192 ft in old money).  Although not popular in design at the time, this template has been used on many notable churches over the world.   St Andrews church in Glasgow, and St Andrews church in Chennai, India.
The church is now famous for its work with the homeless and youth.  It also has many concerts as well as jazz sessions in the Crypt.
The east window was designed by Shirazeh Houshiary and Pip Horne, it was manufactured by Michael Mayer of Munich.  It reminds me of Edmund Munch’s ‘The Scream’.

THIS TABLET
IS DEDICATED TO THE MEMORY OF
JOSEPH BONSOR ESQ.
OF POLESDEN IN THIS PARISH
WHO DIED NOV 13TH 1835
AGED 67 

A London stationer and bookseller, owner of Polesden Lacey from 1818 (following the playwright and Whig politician R.B. Sheridan), succeeded by his son 
Died in Salisbury Square, Fleet Street, London.

&quot;This gentleman was the founder of his own fortune. He was born at Retford, in Nottinghamshire, and served his time to a bookseller and printer in that town. On the expiration of his apprenticeship he came up [sic] to London , with a strong recommendation to Mr. Walter, father to the present member for Berkshire, which shortly led to his undertaking to supply the paper on which the Times was printed, and which he continued to do for some years. About the year 1796 he commenced business as a wholesale stationer in Salisbury Square, and by continued attention to the concern, as well as by strictly upright, liberal and honourable conduct, soon placed it amongst the first wholesale houses in the trade. His prosperity and success in life, however, never interfered with his accustomed attention to business; but his prospects still continuing to brighten, about the year 1818 he purchased of Charles Sheridan, esq. son of the celebrated R. B. Sheridan, about 320 acres of the estate of Polesden, in Surrey, where he first built a snug farm-house and buildings, and a few years subsequently erected a handsome mansion on the site of the old dwelling, taken bown by the late R. B. Sheridan.
   The situation on which the house is placed is most beautiful, commanding a distant view of Box-hill on the left, and a home prospect, a natural amphitheatre, as lovely as can well be imagined. Here Mr Bonsor used, during the summer months, to retire, at the end of the week, to enjoy its comforts with his family and friends, and a more delightful spot in which to partake of the pleasures of retirement it is impossible to imagine. The grounds are picturesque, and laid out with great taste, and a terrace walk of 1200 feet in length, protected from the north by a lofty row of beeches, renders it one of the most pleasant parades which can well be conceived; and which Admiral Sir w. Geary, when he occupied the place, and whose property it had once been, used to call his 'quarter deck'.
   To his family, and to those friends with whom he was more particularly upon terms of intimacy, Mr. Bonsor's loss is inreparable [sic]. He was uniformly most kindand affectionate to the one, and always hospitable and attentive to the other, and he will long be sincerely lamented and  and regretted; and by none, out of the family, more than by the writer of this article.
   Mr. Bonsor has left a widow, about his own age, a son and a daughter, to lament the great loss they have sustained in his sudden decease, occasioned by ossification of the heart. His son was some time since called to the bar, and his daughter is married to Mr. M. Orme, of Doctors' Commons.&quot;

Situated in St Martin’s Lane, WC2, the entrance to the church faces Trafalgar Square and the National Gallery.
The year 1222 is the earliest reference to the church, however there is not much known about it until 1542, when, in the reign of Henry VIII, he had it rebuilt.  Apparently to house plague victims and prevent them from passing through the Palace of Westminster.
In 1606 the building was enlarged, being built over the old graveyard.  This was in the reign of James I, at the same time the old part of the church was fully renovated.  Sometime later in the 1600’s galleries were added to increase the size of the congregation.  Nell Gwynne was buried there.
During the eighteenth century funds were allocated to build new church, the architect James Gibbs was chosen to do the work.  Between 1722, when the foundation stone was laid and 1724, the work was completed.  The spire rises to 59mtrs (192 ft in old money).  Although not popular in design at the time, this template has been used on many notable churches over the world.   St Andrews church in Glasgow, and St Andrews church in Chennai, India.
The church is now famous for its work with the homeless and youth.  It also has many concerts as well as jazz sessions in the Crypt.
The east window was designed by Shirazeh Houshiary and Pip Horne, it was manufactured by Michael Mayer of Munich.  It reminds me of Edmund Munch’s ‘The Scream’.  Although, that is not, the original intention.  The Jacob’s Ladder story, being the influence.","churchesandcathedralsofengland, churchesofengland, churches, stmartinsinthefields, interior, interiors, londonscenes, londonchurches, stmartinoftours",9,51.508909,-0.126546,"Essex","England","2014-09-18 10:43:13"

The company was formed  in 1881 after the Marquis Jules-Albert de Dion saw a scientific toy locomotive in a shop run by engineers Georges Bouton and his brother-in-law Charles Trepardoux.
The brothers had ambitions to build a steam car but neither could afford to finance the operation, De Dion who had a fascination with steam railway locomotives could and a partnership was formed. Their first, unsuccessful car was built in 1883 but by 1887 one was a entered by De Dion in a trial (race) billed as Europe's first motoring competition. There were no other entries but the car did successfully complete the course, and still survives today being a regular entrant in the London to Brighton run.  more steam vehicles and tractors followed.
Trepardoux resigned from the company in 1894, and the company became known as De Dion Bouton et Compagnie. The first internal combustion engined car was produced in 1895. By 1900 De Dion Bouton had become the worlds largest automobile manufacturer producing 400 cars and 3,200 engines and a factory was opened in the USA at Brooklyn in New York. And there were an estimated 150 other companies purchasing and using the de Dion Bouton engines. They went on to produce the first successful V8 engine.
Car production peaked in 1908, during WW1 production concentrated on gun parts, armoured vehicles, car trucks, and aircraft engines.
Post war the company stagnated and, for much of 1927 the factory closed before re-opening. Takeover bids from Peugeot and Mercedes failed to materialize and passenger car production ceased in 1932. Small numbers of commercial vehicles continued to be produced and the last vehicles to carry the badge were licence built Land Rovers in the 1950's.
As well as road vehicles De Dion Bouton produced large numbers of rail cars on various gauges for both France and a large export market.
The company name was bought  by a motorcycle manufacturer in 1955

Automobiles Darracq SA. was founded by Alexandre Darracq in 1896 following his sale of the Gladiator cycle factory. He established a premises in Suresnes a suburb of Paris.
In 1902 he signed a contract with Adam Opel to jointly produce a brand known as the Opel Darracq and three years later he expanded to Britain, establishing the Darracq Company in 1905 with a £ 650,000 capitalization.
An early participant in Motor racing a Darracq set a Land Speed Record in 1904 driven by Paul Baras to 104.53mph in Ostend,Belgium., and again in 1905 when driver Victor Hemery drove a V8 Special to 109.65mph in Arres, France before being shipped to the USA where it achieved 122.45mph at Daytona Beach. Darracq also won the 1905 and 1906 Vanderbilt Cup race at Long Island, New York.
The British interests were sold to British financial interests led by Owen Clegg who relocated to the Paris headquarters. In 1919 Darracq took over the British Talbot company who were then marketed as Talbot Darracq. In 1920 the organisation was re-organised under the Sunbeam-Talbot-Darracq conglomerate (STD), and in 1935 was purchased by the Rootes Group

When his experimental steam tram went up in flames in 1894, locomotive engineer Goerge Johnston turned to internal combustion, building a heavy Dogcart with an opposed twin engine with four pistons. A syndicate was formed to produce this Mo-Car was headed by Sir William Argyll engineer of The Forth (Rail) Bridge. The car was started by pulling a rope through the florboards, and the Dogcart was built until 1906 

This Arrol-Johnston Dogart was built in the Paisley works in 1902 and used by a Doctor in the North of Scotland until around 1908 when it was retired to his stables, remaining there until 1948, when it was aquired by The Sword Collection, and later by the Yorkshire Car Collection, its present owner being only the fourth in 115 years

Cadillac was founded in 1902, originally being the Henry Ford Company, and adopted their company name from Antoine de la Mothe Cadillac who founded Detroit in 1701.
After Henry Ford was replaced by Henry leland (the master of precission), Leland practiced rigorous interchangeability of parts and his single cylinder Cadillac (1903-08) won the 1908 Dewar Cup in a spectacular demonstration of this when three new Cadillacs were disasembled their parts scrambled and three cars built from the pile of bits without any hand fitting.

The first Vauxhall of 1903 was a 5 hp  American inspired Runabout with chain drive and tiller steering. A 6 hp version rapidly followed, with the luxury of a reverse gear. Vauhall then moved from Vauxhall, London to Luton and introduced three models with three cylinder, vertical engines.
These were successfully used in Trials and Hillclimbs.

Following discussions with  Infiniti/Renault-sponsored Formula 1 driver Sebastian Vettel a special version of the FX was launched in 2012.
Distinctive features of the Sebastian Vettel Version include matte white exterior color, F1-inspired carbon fiber front air dam with white LED running lights, F1-inspired side skirts and rear air dam, 21-inch 10-spoke black-finish aluminum wheels, dark tinted adaptive headlamps, dark tinted rear tail lamps, satin aluminum door handles, side air vents and exterior trim, carbon fiber rear wing, carbon fiber interior trim, F1-inspired steering wheel and suede seating surfaces. The vehicle has unique Sebastian Vettel badging on the side fenders, rear liftgate, interior center console and embroidered front seats.
Vettel had made it clear that any FX bearing his name needed to be performance-oriented. Therefore, the Sebastian Vettel Version incorporates the same 5.0-liter 32-valve V8 DOHC VK50VE as the FX50; however with reflashing the engine's computer and adding a new exhaust system, engineers were able to boost the output to 414 hp Vettel worked with Infiniti engineers to transform the FX50 into a lower, sleeker machine; the front air dam provides increased downforce, and the vehicle sits 20 millimeters lower and has 30 percent improved coefficient of drag than the standard FX. With this increase in horsepower, better aerodynamics and taller gearing, Infiniti says the Sebastian Vettel Version accelerates from 0 to 60 miles per hour in under 5 seconds, with a top speed of 186 mph
UK model went on sale for £100,800, with carbon rear spoiler available at an extra cost.

Pentonville Prison, London, designed by Captain Joshua Jebb, was completed in 1842

The Irish revolutionary Ruairí Dáithí Mac Easmainn / Roger Casement was hanged there on 3 August, 1916, and his remains interred at the site until 1965. Casement has been described as the &quot;father of twentieth-century human rights investigations.&quot; It is said that it was seeing the atrocities of colonialists which caused him to turn against the Empire. 

Udham Singh, the Indian revolutionary, who shot Sir Michael O'Dwyer, Governor of the Punjab during the Amritsar Massacre, en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jallianwala_Bagh_massacre was also held in custody and hanged there in 1940.

Porsche originally began experimenting with a Turbo charged version of the 911 Carrera in order to produce a street legal homologation version of the racing car. But despite regulation on the homologation of the race car changing Porsche pressed on with the development of the road car, and it would go on to help as a basis for the 934 and 935 racers. The programme was left in the hands of Ernst Fuhrmann who adapted the turbo technology originally developed for the 917/30 Can Am car to the 3000 cc flat six with an output of 256 bhp. Together with a revised suspension, larger brakes and gearbox. A whale tail spoiler to ensure improved air supply to the engine and to increase downforce, grip was improved with wider rear wheels, upgraded tyres under flared wheel arches.
The car debut at Paris in 1974 as the 911 Turbo but in the US was known as the 930.
In 1978 the car received n upgraded 3300 cc engine with a air-air inter-cooler which increased the output to 300 bhp the brakes were upgrade and the spoiler re-profiled in harmony with the inter-cooler.
In 1980 the 930 was withdrawn from the US and Japan in the face of more stringent emission laws, but remained on sale in Europe. In 1983 a 325 bhp package as a special order with an additional four pipe exhaust an additional oil cooler requiring a re-profiled spoiler and modified rockers.
Porsche discontinued the 930 after model year 1989 when its underlying &quot;G-Series&quot; platform was being replaced by the 964. The 1989 models were the first and last versions of the 930 to feature the G50 transmission, a five-speed manual transmission.

The company was formed  in 1881 after the Marquis Jules-Albert de Dion saw a scientific toy locomotive in a shop run by engineers Georges Bouton and his brother-in-law Charles Trepardoux.
The brothers had ambitions to build a steam car but neither could afford to finance the operation, De Dion who had a fascination with steam railway locomotives could and a partnership was formed. Their first, unsuccessful car was built in 1883 but by 1887 one was a entered by De Dion in a trial (race) billed as Europe's first motoring competition. There were no other entries but the car did successfully complete the course, and still survives today being a regular entrant in the London to Brighton run.  more steam vehicles and tractors followed.
Trepardoux resigned from the company in 1894, and the company became known as De Dion Bouton et Compagnie. The first internal combustion engined car was produced in 1895. By 1900 De Dion Bouton had become the worlds largest automobile manufacturer producing 400 cars and 3,200 engines and a factory was opened in the USA at Brooklyn in New York. And there were an estimated 150 other companies purchasing and using the de Dion Bouton engines. They went on to produce the first successful V8 engine.
Car production peaked in 1908, during WW1 production concentrated on gun parts, armoured vehicles, car trucks, and aircraft engines.
Post war the company stagnated and, for much of 1927 the factory closed before re-opening. Takeover bids from Peugeot and Mercedes failed to materialize and passenger car production ceased in 1932. Small numbers of commercial vehicles continued to be produced and the last vehicles to carry the badge were licence built Land Rovers in the 1950's.
As well as road vehicles De Dion Bouton produced large numbers of rail cars on various gauges for both France and a large export market.
The company name was bought  by a motorcycle manufacturer in 1955

The Stanley twins, F. E. and F. O. Stanley built their first car as hobby project in 1897, after they had sold their photographic plate business to Kodak.The car was an instant hit and the brothers started to receive customer orders, to the exyent that a batch of 200 steam buggies was commenced, but  they were promptly bought out for $ 250,000 by a consortium to build the design as the Locomobile.
So back to the drawing board and the brothers came up with an improved design with a twin cylinder engine geared directly to the back axle. Going into production in 1901 the fire tube boiler was eventually shifted to the front under the trademark Stanley coffin nose bonnet.
In 1906 a racing Stanley Steamer exceeded 127 mph on Ormond Beach, Daytona. By 1907 the production Roadster could reach 75mph
The Stanley Brother continued at the helm of the company until 1917, suceeded by Prescot Warren who remained until 1924, but the company never recovered from the post WW1 slumo, the company was taken over by the Steam Vehicle Corporation of America but it is unlikely that any further vehicles were built, and they ceased trading in 1927

But I began to wonder if by some chance I had captured this building in one of the photos that I had taken in August 2014 for the 150th Anniversary of the Hammersmith and City Line. I know I had shot the anniversary special from Latimer Road Station but didn't know if Grenfell Tower would feature in any of them. 

So having a look through the photos from that day I came across this shot. Perhaps I took it because of the lines and angles in it or because I just took it while waiting for 'Sarah Siddons' and 'Met No.1' to turn up (a few minutes after this shot was taken) or perhaps I just took it because it was a tower block looming over the station like it does.   

Being taken in 2014 this shot was taken about a year before the renovation between 2015-16 that turned this 70s tower block into the death trap that has so far claimed the lives of 80 people.

The scheme had a complex web of stakeholders, clients, multi-tiered statutory consultees and its own Games planning authority.

We designed an expansive playscape delivering innovative and challenging play experiences for all ages. Our inspiration was ecological processes, linking into the surrounding riverine landscape. The undulating topography envelops the popular new café and multi-functional community hub.

The BREEAM Excellent-rated Tumbling Bay progresses through a series of character areas: a hazel copse and birch pioneer woodland encouraging den-making and play-trails; a sand and water area inspired by the history of the River Lee, where children can become water engineers; and climax woodland – the challenging Scots Pine area with climbing nets, organic treetop pods and connecting bridges.

Visitor numbers quickly exceeded those initially anticipated, and the scheme is bringing people into the park in advance of the creation of the surrounding neighbourhoods, providing future local residents, national and international visitors, with a well-loved, exciting place to play.

When it opened, this project won several awards, a Civic Trust Award; the Civic Trust Selwyn Goldsmith Award for Universal design; best ‘Public Space’ at the New London Awards; and the ‘Small scale public development’ category at the Landscape Institute Awards.

Saturday 27th September 2014.

Thanks to the efforts of Tom Gurney a selection of Orpington midi-buses continue to survive and enable scenes such as this to be recreated for many years to come. For further information about the services and buses on the Roundabout network I can highly recommend Tom's book &quot;Roundabout: Orpington's Little Buses&quot; which in my opinion is one of the most detailed books on any London bus topic.

34722841682,"134280843@N03","3",NA,"Darth Vader's Catwalk","<b>Kings Cross Underground Station, London, England</b>

I haven't forgotten about you all here on Flickr, just been so busy, a lot of stuff going on at the moment so my photography has taken a little bit of a back seat. 

So I thought I would treat you all. Going back a few years ago I visited this awesome new tunnel as part of Kings Cross Underground redevelopment. I spent an age here taking various photos and different POVs. It took me a while to like this one as the way the tunnel curves away makes the floor not flat in the distance.
 
If you have not been to this tunnel well you must! Its great and quite unique to London, I don't know any other tunnel like it in London (correct me if I am wrong).

<b>Location Information</b>
The first underground station at King's Cross opened as part of the original section of the Metropolitan Railway in 1863 and was rearranged in 1868 and 1926. New platforms for the sub-surface lines of the Underground were opened about 400 m (440 yd) to the west in 1941 to make interchanging between the sub-surface lines and the tube lines easier; the 1868 platforms later became the former King's Cross Thameslink station, which closed on 9 December 2007 when the Thameslink service moved to St Pancras International. One of the platforms may be seen from Underground trains between the present station and Farringdon.

The Great Northern, Piccadilly and Brompton Railway (GNP&amp;BR, now part of the Piccadilly line) platforms opened with the rest of the line in December 1906, while the City &amp; South London Railway (C&amp;SLR, now part of the Northern line) arrived in May 1907. The Victoria line platforms came into use on 1 December 1968 with the opening of the second phase of the line. The Victoria line escalators cut through the location of the original Piccadilly line lifts.

Memorial plaque to the 1987 fire in the station
On 18 November 1987 the station was the scene of a devastating fire that killed 31 people. The cause was attributed to a lit match falling into the space under the escalator, setting fire to the grease and rubbish present there, then to the wooden parts of the escalator. The then-unknown fire phenomenon of the trench effect made the fire develop upwards and finally caused it to explode into the station. As a result, fire safety procedures on the Underground were tightened, staff training was improved and wooden steps on escalators were replaced with metal ones. The existing prohibition of smoking throughout the London Underground network was tightened. Due to the extensive damage caused by the fire, it took over a year to repair and reopen the station; the Northern line platforms and the escalators from the ticket hall to the Piccadilly line remained closed until 5 March 1989.

On 7 July 2005, as part of a co-ordinated bomb attack, an explosion in a Piccadilly line train travelling between King's Cross St Pancras and Russell Square resulted in the deaths of 26 people.","lines, curves, tunnel, sonyalphaslta99, metallic, kingscross, walkway, vignetting, sonycarlzeissvariosonnart1635mmf28zassm, new, unitedkingdom, blue, urban, underground, travel, motion, green, europe, kingscrossundergroundstation, blur, england, empty, lowdown, a99, reflection, line, city, aaronyeoman, glass, tfl, purple, red, modern, reflections, undergroundstation, slta99, northlondon, london, rapidtransit, curve, sonya99, tubestation, architecture, railway, sonyslta99, camden, station, blurred",1257,51.533055,-0.125,NA,NA,"2014-07-14 12:10:56"
